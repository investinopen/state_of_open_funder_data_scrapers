Abstract: Discovery and Clinical Application Type 2 Diabetes Genes Despite great progress in biomedical research, the root causes of common diseases remain largely unknown; we have limited ability to prevent disease before it occurs, and few cures to offer once present. The long-term objective of our research is to identify inherited DNA variations that predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D), and using this information, deploy existing treatments more effectively and design more effective interventions. Our work is based on the observation that family history is one of the strongest influences on any disease: that is, rates of disease are more correlated in first degree relatives than in unrelated individuals, and strikingly more so in identical twins. Our past efforts have helped create a foundation of knowledge and methods that make possible systematic study of human genome sequence variation for its contribution to T2D and other diseases. We are currently testing 500,000 common genetic variations for association to T2D in 1,500 cases and 1,500 matched controls, and other such studies are ongoing. It is reasonable to expect that these (and even more powerful methods to come) will soon yield novel insights into the biological basis and population risk of T2D. Translating this information to clinical medicine is the goal of this proposal. First, we will study whether and how DNA variants associated with risk of T2D might offer clinical information about progression from impaired glucose tolerance to T2D, and response to interventions. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms found to be reproducibly associated with T2D in the whole genome scans will be genotyped in DNA samples from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized intervention trial of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with progression to T2D as an endpoint. Together with colleagues in the DPP we will ask whether these genetic variants predict progression from IGT to T2D, and of altered response to lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that delay onset of T2D. Based on these findings we will design a clinical trial asking whether genetically tailored diagnosis and therapy improves outcomes compared to standard care. Second, we will develop new therapeutic leads based on novel information about inherited variants that predispose to risk of T2D. Specifically, we will study cells from carriers of specific risk genotypes, and in which the level of confirmed risk genes have been modified using RNAi and over-expression. Using genome-wide expression profiling we will search for signatures of altered gene sequence and activity. We will then use gene-expression high throughput screening (GE-HTS) to search for small molecules that reverse the signature of the at-risk genotypes or altered level of gene function, aiming to identify lead compounds for future study. Third, we will create a suite of educational programs to enhance the mentoring and training of clinical investigators interested in applying genetics and genomics to clinical practice. Specifically, we will develop educational materials tailored for use on the wards, and organize an annual symposium for investigators who are embarking on careers in clinical genomic research, with the goal of having them get to know one another, to share ideas, and to brainstorm together about important goals and how to overcome obstacles to progress. The proposed research aims to translate genetic information into more effective use of existing therapies, to catalyze discovery of new therapies, and to train the next generation of clinical genetic investigators.

Abstract: New Treatment of Childhood Genetic Kidney Diseases Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory has advanced the understanding of disease mechanisms of hereditary kidney diseases in childhood that are associated with blindness or hearing loss. This includes cystic kidney diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and urinary tract malformations. His laboratory has identified by positional cloning ten novel genes. The identification of six genes mutated in nephronophthisis with retinitis pigmentosa contributed to a new unifying pathogenic concept of cystic kidney diseases that is based on the function of primary cilia, a sensory organelle. Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory identified the first gene mutated in a treatable form of nephrotic syndrome and in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Insights into kidney development were gained through positional cloning of the BSND gene mutated in Bartter syndrome with deafness, and of SIX1 mutations in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome. These studies helped elucidate the pathogenesis of developmental defects of the kidney, the eye, and auditory system, and allow for the generation of disease models to test new treatment approaches. Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory provides molecular genetic diagnostics on an experimental basis for children with hereditary kidney disease worldwide.  William G. Kaelin, M.D. William G. Kaelin Jr., M.D., is a Professor in the Department of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. He obtained his undergraduate and M.D. degrees from Duke University and completed his training in internal medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he served as chief medical resident. He was a clinical fellow in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and later a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Livingston, during which time he was a McDonnell Scholar. Dr. Kaelin is a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation and the American College of Physicians. He recently served on the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Advisors, the AACR Board of Trustees, and the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board. He is a recipient of the Paul Marks Prize for cancer research from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Prize from the AACR. A Howard Hughes Medical Investigator since 1998, Dr. Kaelin's research seeks to understand how, mechanistically, mutations affecting tumor-suppressor genes cause cancer. His laboratory is currently focused on studies of the VHL, RB-1, and p53 tumor suppressor genes. His long-term goal is to lay the foundation for new anticancer therapies based on the biochemical functions of such proteins. His work on the VHL protein led to new insights into how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen, and thus has implications for diseases beyond cancer, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Abstract: Translational Studies Based on Tumor Suppressor Proteins Over 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer each year resulting in approximately 12,000 kidney cancer-related deaths per year. About 1 in 35,000 people are born with a defective copy of the VHL gene and are at increased risk of kidney cancer. Importantly, acquired (rather than inherited) mutations of the VHL gene are also very common in non-hereditary kidney cancer. In short, inactivation of the VHL gene is a common event in both hereditary and non-hereditary kidney cancer. Genes are usually 'blueprints' for making particular proteins. The VHL gene contains the information for making the VHL protein ('pVHL'), which inhibits a protein called 'HIF'. HIF, in turn, activates ~ 100 genes implicated in cell growth and angiogenesis (the process of making new blood vessels), including VEGF. Most successful drugs work by binding to, and inhibiting, a specific cellular protein (its 'target'). Drugs that inhibit VEGF have demonstrated significant activity as treatments for kidney cancer, in terms of tumor shrinkage and delayed tumor growth, but are not curative. This proposal seeks to build upon these results. One set of experiments seeks to identify new kidney cancer drug targets by systematically searching for genes that are essential for survival in cells lacking pVHL, but not in normal cells. In theory, drugs that inhibited the proteins encoded by such genes should selectively kill tumor cells bearing VHL mutations. Inactivation of the VHL gene is not sufficient to cause kidney cancer; mutations of additional genes are also clearly required. State of the art techniques will be used to try to identify such genes because they should define additional molecular circuits that are abnormal in kidney cancer cells. These circuits could then be targeted with drugs. This proposal will also attempt to identify proteins ('biomarkers') that can be easily measured in clinical samples (such as blood or urine) to monitor the presence of kidney cancers in patients and/or to document that kidney cancer drugs have successfully inhibited their targets. In some cases drugs will already be available, or in development, for the targets identified in this proposal. In other cases partnerships with the private sector will be required to develop such drugs. The final goal of this proposal is to perform kidney cancer clinical trials with novel drugs that are based on knowledge of the genes that are altered in this disease, as outlined above.  Elizabeth M. McNally, M.D., Ph.D. Elizabeth McNally is a professor at the University of Chicago where she studies the genetics of inherited heart disease and inherited muscle disease. Dr. McNally was born in Chicago and received her undergraduate degree at Barnard College majoring in Philosophy and Biology. She received her M.D. and Ph.D. degrees participating in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. McNally was clinically trained at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Diseases. She was a fellow in Genetics at Children's Hospital in Boston and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. McNally studies the genetic defects that lead to heart and muscle weakness. She directs the Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic at the University of Chicago that specializes in inherited cardiomyopathies, the cardiomyopathy that accompanies neuromuscular disease and other inherited cardiovascular disorders. The discovery of gene defects in patients and families with inherited heart disease helps identify those that are at higher risk of developing disease. Dr. McNally is now planning to study the epigenetic mechanisms that lead to cardiomyopathy and to combine genetic studies with imaging to identify the earliest markers of cardiomyopathy. These studies will also test whether early treatment can slow or prevent the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Dr. McNally was a Culpeper Medical Scholar and received a Clinical Translational Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation. Dr. McNally is also supported by the National Institutes of Health. She is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians. Dr. McNally works closely with the Muscular Dystrophy Association serving on its Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. McNally is also dedicated to training physician scientists by directing the Cardiovascular Sciences Training Program at the University of Chicago. Abstract: Epigenetics of Heart Failure Cardiomyopathy, or weakness of the heart muscle, is a leading cause of congestive heart failure, one of the most common hospital diagnoses in the United States. Cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutations in single genes, where it can lead to heart failure and life-threatening irregular heart rhythms. Most of the genes that are associated with cardiomyopathy encode proteins that are specifically important for heart muscle function. One gene that is associated with cardiomyopathy encodes a protein of the nuclear membrane that is thought to have a role in regulating nuclear function such as the expression of genes. Dr. McNally will study patients with mutations in genes that cause cardiomyopathy to try to understand new mechanisms of heart failure. Dr. McNally will also work to identify how the nuclear membrane is important for the proper function of heart cells. Lastly, Dr. McNally will work with patients and families who are at risk of developing heart failure to identify new markers and determine therapy that can slow or halt the progression of cardiomyopathy.  Christopher V. Plowe, M.D., M.P.H. Chris Plowe is a physician and malariologist who leads a multidisciplinary clinical translational malaria research at the University of Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development, with field sites in Mali, West Africa and Malawi, Central Africa. He is best known for his work on the molecular epidemiology of drug resistant malaria. Working with African colleagues, his group at the University of Maryland developed rapid molecular assays to detect drug resistant malaria using dried blood spots on paper. These tests have been used to understand the population genetics of malaria and to control malaria outbreaks and inform treatment policy decisions. Dr. Plowe's work encompasses malaria drug resistance, molecular epidemiology, molecular evolution, rapid diagnostics, pathogenesis, immunology, international research ethics, interactions between HIV and malaria, and clinical trials of drugs and vaccines. His group is currently concentrating on understanding and mitigating the impact of genetic diversity on malaria vaccine efficacy and on developing strategies to deter the emergence and spread of drug resistant malaria. Dr. Plowe was born and raised in South Dakota, the second of six children of a clergyman/farmer and a Vassar-educated housewife. He is a tenured Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Malaria Section in the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. He received a BA in Philosophy from Cornell University in 1982, an MD from Cornell in 1986, and an MPH in Tropical Medicine from Columbia University in 1991. After training in malaria research at the National Institutes of Health and in infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University he joined the University of Maryland faculty in 1995. He was awarded the Ashford Medal for distinguished work in tropical medicine from the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 2002 and was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 2005. He provides expert advice on malaria research and control to national and international agencies and has testified before Congress on tropical medicine research priorities and before a Presidential commission on international research ethics. He divides his time between his laboratories in Baltimore, the Bandiagara Malaria Project in Mali and the Blantyre Malaria Project in Malawi. He enjoys playing music with his children and riding motorcycles with his wife. Abstract: Antigenic Diversity and Malaria Vaccine Efficacy \"Malaria parasites mutate and evolve so quickly that drugs and vaccines are always chasing a moving target,\" says Dr. Chris Plowe, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Center for Vaccine Development's Malaria Section at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Plowe's project, \"Genetic Diversity and Malaria Vaccine Efficacy\", will combine molecular studies in the Center for Vaccine Development with clinical trials in Mali, West Africa, to understand how malaria parasites evolve to evade attack from the human immune system. Plowe's team at the University of Maryland and colleagues at the University of Bamako in Mali hope that learning how the malaria parasite genome is shaped by both natural and vaccine-induced immunity will lead to a vaccine that protects people against genetically diverse malaria parasites. \"This award will help us exploit the amazing advances in malaria genomics to improve a malaria vaccine we are testing now in Mali,\" says Plowe. \"It's as if malaria parasites can change their coats so that they aren't recognized. We need to beat the parasite at its own game by making a vaccine that helps the body's defenses recognizes malaria parasites whether they are wearing a red parka or a blue blazer.\" The Doris Duke award will also support research training for medical students and young doctors to work with Dr. Plowe and his team both at the University of Maryland and in Africa.  David Relman, M.D. David Relman, M.D., is associate professor of medicine, and of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. He is also chief, infectious diseases section, at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System in Palo Alto, California. A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Dr. Relman holds an S.B. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received his M.D. degree, magna cum laude, from Harvard Medical School in 1982. Following postdoctoral clinical training at Massachusetts General Hospital in Internal Medicine and in Infectious Diseases, Dr. Relman served as a postdoctoral research fellow in microbiology at Stanford University in the laboratory of Stanley Falkow from 1986 until 1992. He joined the Stanford University faculty in 1992 and was appointed associate professor (with tenure) in 2001. His research is directed towards the characterization of the human indigenous microbial communities of the mouth and gut, with emphasis on understanding variation in diversity, succession, the effects of disturbance, and the role of these communities in oral and intestinal disease. Experimental approaches include molecular phylogenetics, ecological statistics, single cell genomics, and community-wide metagenomics. A second area of research concerns the classification structure of humans and non-human primates with systemic infectious diseases, based on patterns of genome-wide gene transcript abundance in blood and other tissues. The goals of this work are to recognize classes of pathogen and predict clinical outcome at early time points in the disease process, as well as gain further insights into virulence (e.g., of variola and monkeypox viruses). Past achievements include the description of a novel approach for identifying previously-unknown pathogens, the identification of a number of new human microbial pathogens, including the agent of Whipple's disease, and the most extensive descriptions to date of the human indigenous microbial community. Dr. Relman received the Squibb Award from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (2001), the Senior Scholar Award in Global Infectious Diseases from the Ellison Medical Foundation (2002), and is a recipient of an NIH Director's Pioneer Award (2006). He is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and was named a Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology in 2003.

Abstract: Microbial Ecology of the Human Intestinal Tract The human body is a consortium between human cells and microbial cells. The latter outnumber the former by approximately ten-fold. Each cell type depends upon the other. Although we know that our microbial inhabitants provide a number of critical functions, we know little about the make-up of our microbial communities in health, and how they may contribute to a variety of disease states. The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed work are a more complete understanding and definition of human health based on the patterns of diversity within indigenous microbial community, the identification of microbial community \"signatures\" that predict the development or course of local disease, and strategies for the maintenance or restoration of health that involve well-informed manipulations of the human microbial communities.

She is certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board in Internal Medicine and in Canada, and in Medical Oncology by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 2002, Dr. Slingerland came to the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine as the Director of the Braman Family Breast Cancer Institute, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center where she is working to expand and coordinate multidisciplinary breast cancer research. She has published over 60 articles and reviews in addition to several book chapters and has received numerous awards. Dr. Slingerland continues her medical practice devoted entirely to breast cancer patients at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center and the Jackson Memorial Hospital. Dr. Slingerland's lab research has provided insights into how cancers escape negative growth controls. Following her discovery of a key cell cycle inhibitor, p27, she found that p27 levels are reduced in up to 60% of common human cancers (breast, prostate, lung, ovarian and others) in association with poor patient prognosis. She also showed that cell cycle inhibitors p15 and p27 cooperate to cause G1 arrest by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and that cancer cells lose responsiveness to TGF-beta through loss or deregulation of p27. Current work addresses how p27 function is impaired in human breast and other cancers. Functional inactivation of p27 in human cancers can either occur through accelerated p27 degradation or through altered p27 phosphorylation leading to p27 mislocalization. Slingerland's group demonstrated that antiestrogen drugs require the cdk inhibitors p21 and p27 to arrest breast cancer growth. She showed that oncogenic signaling via the Src and MEK pathways deregulate p27 function causing tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. Efforts to prevent or reverse hormone independent, antiestrogen resistant breast cancer growth using EGFR, MEK and Src inhibitors are under investigation in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Abstract: Molecular Therapies for Hormone Resistant Breast Cancer About two-thirds of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor (ER). These ER positive breast cancers can be treated with antiestrogen drugs like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. Unfortunately, most breast cancers develop resistance to these drugs. Our lab has shown that estrogen promotes breast cancer growth by causing the degradation of a key cell cycle inhibitor, p27. We also showed that estrogen deprivation and drugs that block the ER, like tamoxifen, depend on p27 to cause breast cancer cells to stop growing. p27 levels are often reduced in human breast cancers and this predicts poor patient outcome and poor response to tamoxifen therapy. Our recent work showed that the oncogene Src acts on p27 to change its shape and function and promotes p27 degradation in breast cancer cells. This grant will investigate further how Src alters both where p27 is in the cell and how its function is regulated. We will examine a series of tissues from human breast cancer samples to test whether Src activation is associated with reduced p27 protein and if both of these findings together may predict poor patient outcome. Given the strength of our observations in the laboratory, we plan to test if a new Src inhibitor drug can delay or prevent resistance to antiestrogens therapy. We will carry out a Phase I-II clinical trial of the Src inhibitor, AZD0530, together with antiestrogens therapy for metastatic and locally advanced breast cancer. These studies will increase our understanding of the relationship between Src activation and loss of the growth inhibitory effect of p27 in human breast cancer, and apply this knowledge to design new more effective strategies to treat women with antiestrogens resistant breast cancer.

Abstract: Discovery and Clinical Application Type 2 Diabetes Genes Despite great progress in biomedical research, the root causes of common diseases remain largely unknown; we have limited ability to prevent disease before it occurs, and few cures to offer once present. The long-term objective of our research is to identify inherited DNA variations that predispose to type 2 diabetes (T2D), and using this information, deploy existing treatments more effectively and design more effective interventions. Our work is based on the observation that family history is one of the strongest influences on any disease: that is, rates of disease are more correlated in first degree relatives than in unrelated individuals, and strikingly more so in identical twins. Our past efforts have helped create a foundation of knowledge and methods that make possible systematic study of human genome sequence variation for its contribution to T2D and other diseases. We are currently testing 500,000 common genetic variations for association to T2D in 1,500 cases and 1,500 matched controls, and other such studies are ongoing. It is reasonable to expect that these (and even more powerful methods to come) will soon yield novel insights into the biological basis and population risk of T2D. Translating this information to clinical medicine is the goal of this proposal. First, we will study whether and how DNA variants associated with risk of T2D might offer clinical information about progression from impaired glucose tolerance to T2D, and response to interventions. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms found to be reproducibly associated with T2D in the whole genome scans will be genotyped in DNA samples from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a randomized intervention trial of patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with progression to T2D as an endpoint. Together with colleagues in the DPP we will ask whether these genetic variants predict progression from IGT to T2D, and of altered response to lifestyle and pharmacological interventions that delay onset of T2D. Based on these findings we will design a clinical trial asking whether genetically tailored diagnosis and therapy improves outcomes compared to standard care. Second, we will develop new therapeutic leads based on novel information about inherited variants that predispose to risk of T2D. Specifically, we will study cells from carriers of specific risk genotypes, and in which the level of confirmed risk genes have been modified using RNAi and over-expression. Using genome-wide expression profiling we will search for signatures of altered gene sequence and activity. We will then use gene-expression high throughput screening (GE-HTS) to search for small molecules that reverse the signature of the at-risk genotypes or altered level of gene function, aiming to identify lead compounds for future study. Third, we will create a suite of educational programs to enhance the mentoring and training of clinical investigators interested in applying genetics and genomics to clinical practice. Specifically, we will develop educational materials tailored for use on the wards, and organize an annual symposium for investigators who are embarking on careers in clinical genomic research, with the goal of having them get to know one another, to share ideas, and to brainstorm together about important goals and how to overcome obstacles to progress. The proposed research aims to translate genetic information into more effective use of existing therapies, to catalyze discovery of new therapies, and to train the next generation of clinical genetic investigators.

He lives with his wife Sabine Hildebrandt and their two children in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Abstract: New Treatment of Childhood Genetic Kidney Diseases Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory has advanced the understanding of disease mechanisms of hereditary kidney diseases in childhood that are associated with blindness or hearing loss. This includes cystic kidney diseases, nephrotic syndrome, and urinary tract malformations. His laboratory has identified by positional cloning ten novel genes. The identification of six genes mutated in nephronophthisis with retinitis pigmentosa contributed to a new unifying pathogenic concept of cystic kidney diseases that is based on the function of primary cilia, a sensory organelle. Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory identified the first gene mutated in a treatable form of nephrotic syndrome and in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Insights into kidney development were gained through positional cloning of the BSND gene mutated in Bartter syndrome with deafness, and of SIX1 mutations in Branchio-oto-renal syndrome. These studies helped elucidate the pathogenesis of developmental defects of the kidney, the eye, and auditory system, and allow for the generation of disease models to test new treatment approaches. Dr. Hildebrandt's laboratory provides molecular genetic diagnostics on an experimental basis for children with hereditary kidney disease worldwide.  William G. Kaelin, M.D. William G. Kaelin Jr., M.D., is a Professor in the Department of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. He obtained his undergraduate and M.D. degrees from Duke University and completed his training in internal medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he served as chief medical resident. He was a clinical fellow in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and later a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of David Livingston, during which time he was a McDonnell Scholar. Dr. Kaelin is a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation and the American College of Physicians. He recently served on the National Cancer Institute Board of Scientific Advisors, the AACR Board of Trustees, and the Institute of Medicine National Cancer Policy Board. He is a recipient of the Paul Marks Prize for cancer research from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Prize from the AACR. A Howard Hughes Medical Investigator since 1998, Dr. Kaelin's research seeks to understand how, mechanistically, mutations affecting tumor-suppressor genes cause cancer. His laboratory is currently focused on studies of the VHL, RB-1, and p53 tumor suppressor genes. His long-term goal is to lay the foundation for new anticancer therapies based on the biochemical functions of such proteins. His work on the VHL protein led to new insights into how cells sense and respond to changes in oxygen, and thus has implications for diseases beyond cancer, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Abstract: Translational Studies Based on Tumor Suppressor Proteins Over 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer each year resulting in approximately 12,000 kidney cancer-related deaths per year. About 1 in 35,000 people are born with a defective copy of the VHL gene and are at increased risk of kidney cancer. Importantly, acquired (rather than inherited) mutations of the VHL gene are also very common in non-hereditary kidney cancer. In short, inactivation of the VHL gene is a common event in both hereditary and non-hereditary kidney cancer. Genes are usually 'blueprints' for making particular proteins. The VHL gene contains the information for making the VHL protein ('pVHL'), which inhibits a protein called 'HIF'. HIF, in turn, activates ~ 100 genes implicated in cell growth and angiogenesis (the process of making new blood vessels), including VEGF. Most successful drugs work by binding to, and inhibiting, a specific cellular protein (its 'target'). Drugs that inhibit VEGF have demonstrated significant activity as treatments for kidney cancer, in terms of tumor shrinkage and delayed tumor growth, but are not curative. This proposal seeks to build upon these results. One set of experiments seeks to identify new kidney cancer drug targets by systematically searching for genes that are essential for survival in cells lacking pVHL, but not in normal cells. In theory, drugs that inhibited the proteins encoded by such genes should selectively kill tumor cells bearing VHL mutations. Inactivation of the VHL gene is not sufficient to cause kidney cancer; mutations of additional genes are also clearly required. State of the art techniques will be used to try to identify such genes because they should define additional molecular circuits that are abnormal in kidney cancer cells. These circuits could then be targeted with drugs. This proposal will also attempt to identify proteins ('biomarkers') that can be easily measured in clinical samples (such as blood or urine) to monitor the presence of kidney cancers in patients and/or to document that kidney cancer drugs have successfully inhibited their targets. In some cases drugs will already be available, or in development, for the targets identified in this proposal. In other cases partnerships with the private sector will be required to develop such drugs. The final goal of this proposal is to perform kidney cancer clinical trials with novel drugs that are based on knowledge of the genes that are altered in this disease, as outlined above.  Elizabeth M. McNally, M.D., Ph.D. Elizabeth McNally is a professor at the University of Chicago where she studies the genetics of inherited heart disease and inherited muscle disease. Dr. McNally was born in Chicago and received her undergraduate degree at Barnard College majoring in Philosophy and Biology. She received her M.D. and Ph.D. degrees participating in the Medical Scientist Training Program at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dr. McNally was clinically trained at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Diseases. She was a fellow in Genetics at Children's Hospital in Boston and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. McNally studies the genetic defects that lead to heart and muscle weakness. She directs the Cardiovascular Genetics Clinic at the University of Chicago that specializes in inherited cardiomyopathies, the cardiomyopathy that accompanies neuromuscular disease and other inherited cardiovascular disorders. The discovery of gene defects in patients and families with inherited heart disease helps identify those that are at higher risk of developing disease. Dr. McNally is now planning to study the epigenetic mechanisms that lead to cardiomyopathy and to combine genetic studies with imaging to identify the earliest markers of cardiomyopathy. These studies will also test whether early treatment can slow or prevent the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Dr. McNally was a Culpeper Medical Scholar and received a Clinical Translational Award from the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation. Dr. McNally is also supported by the National Institutes of Health. She is a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians. Dr. McNally works closely with the Muscular Dystrophy Association serving on its Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. McNally is also dedicated to training physician scientists by directing the Cardiovascular Sciences Training Program at the University of Chicago. Abstract: Epigenetics of Heart Failure Cardiomyopathy, or weakness of the heart muscle, is a leading cause of congestive heart failure, one of the most common hospital diagnoses in the United States. Cardiomyopathy can be caused by mutations in single genes, where it can lead to heart failure and life-threatening irregular heart rhythms. Most of the genes that are associated with cardiomyopathy encode proteins that are specifically important for heart muscle function. One gene that is associated with cardiomyopathy encodes a protein of the nuclear membrane that is thought to have a role in regulating nuclear function such as the expression of genes. Dr. McNally will study patients with mutations in genes that cause cardiomyopathy to try to understand new mechanisms of heart failure. Dr. McNally will also work to identify how the nuclear membrane is important for the proper function of heart cells. Lastly, Dr. McNally will work with patients and families who are at risk of developing heart failure to identify new markers and determine therapy that can slow or halt the progression of cardiomyopathy.  Christopher V. Plowe, M.D., M.P.H. Chris Plowe is a physician and malariologist who leads a multidisciplinary clinical translational malaria research at the University of Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development, with field sites in Mali, West Africa and Malawi, Central Africa. He is best known for his work on the molecular epidemiology of drug resistant malaria.

These tests have been used to understand the population genetics of malaria and to control malaria outbreaks and inform treatment policy decisions. Dr. Plowe's work encompasses malaria drug resistance, molecular epidemiology, molecular evolution, rapid diagnostics, pathogenesis, immunology, international research ethics, interactions between HIV and malaria, and clinical trials of drugs and vaccines. His group is currently concentrating on understanding and mitigating the impact of genetic diversity on malaria vaccine efficacy and on developing strategies to deter the emergence and spread of drug resistant malaria. Dr. Plowe was born and raised in South Dakota, the second of six children of a clergyman/farmer and a Vassar-educated housewife. He is a tenured Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Malaria Section in the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.

He enjoys playing music with his children and riding motorcycles with his wife. Abstract: Antigenic Diversity and Malaria Vaccine Efficacy \"Malaria parasites mutate and evolve so quickly that drugs and vaccines are always chasing a moving target,\" says Dr. Chris Plowe, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Center for Vaccine Development's Malaria Section at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Plowe's project, \"Genetic Diversity and Malaria Vaccine Efficacy\", will combine molecular studies in the Center for Vaccine Development with clinical trials in Mali, West Africa, to understand how malaria parasites evolve to evade attack from the human immune system. Plowe's team at the University of Maryland and colleagues at the University of Bamako in Mali hope that learning how the malaria parasite genome is shaped by both natural and vaccine-induced immunity will lead to a vaccine that protects people against genetically diverse malaria parasites. \"This award will help us exploit the amazing advances in malaria genomics to improve a malaria vaccine we are testing now in Mali,\" says Plowe. \"It's as if malaria parasites can change their coats so that they aren't recognized. We need to beat the parasite at its own game by making a vaccine that helps the body's defenses recognizes malaria parasites whether they are wearing a red parka or a blue blazer.\" The Doris Duke award will also support research training for medical students and young doctors to work with Dr. Plowe and his team both at the University of Maryland and in Africa.

Experimental approaches include molecular phylogenetics, ecological statistics, single cell genomics, and community-wide metagenomics. A second area of research concerns the classification structure of humans and non-human primates with systemic infectious diseases, based on patterns of genome-wide gene transcript abundance in blood and other tissues. The goals of this work are to recognize classes of pathogen and predict clinical outcome at early time points in the disease process, as well as gain further insights into virulence (e.g., of variola and monkeypox viruses). Past achievements include the description of a novel approach for identifying previously-unknown pathogens, the identification of a number of new human microbial pathogens, including the agent of Whipple's disease, and the most extensive descriptions to date of the human indigenous microbial community.

ART Adherence Among People in Rural Zambian Clinics  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Unfortunately, little is known regarding the determinants of drug adherence in rural regions. To begin to explore patient and organizational-level determinants of ART adherence among patients attending rural clinics in Zambia, we propose to conduct a study at 3 rural ART clinics in the Southern Province of Zambia. By assembling a cohort of new attendees at these rural ART clinics, we will prospectively assess the impact of socioeconomic status, ART-toxicity, social roles/responsibilities, perceived levels of HIV-associated stigma, pre-treatment cognitive deficits, health systems limitations, and co-morbid depression upon ART adherence. Adherence will be quantified based upon pill counts and clinic attendance. Individuals who agree to community-based visits and fail to attend scheduled ART clinic visits will be sought at home to determine reasons for non-adherence. In addition to assessing potential factors associated with poorer adherence, the study team will work with non-adherent patients and ART clinic staff to overcome barriers to treatment adherence for individual patients as these patients are identified. Structured interviews of clinic staff and administration will also be conducted to assist us in understanding underlying causes for health systems limitations that negatively impact adherence.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Virologic monitoring is critical to assessing response to HIV therapy, and decreasing the HIV viral load to levels below those of clinically used assays (i.e., to \"undetectable\" levels), is associated with reversal of HIV-related immune destruction. Viral load assays are, however, too expensive for routine use in the developing world, where the burden of HIV infection is greatest, and low cost approaches to virologic monitoring are needed. Soon after patients start HAART, however, changes such as increases in CD4 count (the main immune cell type affected by HIV) occur in those whose viral loads decrease. Moreover, CD4 cell assays are cheaper and more widely available than viral loads in the developing world. This creates an opportunity to use CD4 cell response as a marker for virologic response during treatment with HAART. Our previous work has shown that use of CD4 response threshold of 50 cells at the 6 month follow-up visit can identify over 50% of virologic failures while avoiding confirmatory viral loads in over 80% of those whose viral loads are undetectable. Another major predictor of virologic response is adherence to therapy, or, taking the medication as prescribed. The specific aim of this project is therefore to develop a clinical prediction rule for achievement of an undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA level 4-6 months after initiation of ARV therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. We are conducting a cohort study in the largest free HIV care clinic in Botswana to categorize patients into various levels of adherence and CD4 response, and then evaluating the public health implications of triaging viral load testing based on these low-cost parameters. For example, it may be most efficient to perform viral loads only in those with adherence less than 80% and CD4 cell response of less than 100 cells from baseline. The project will therefore approach a \"test some\" rather than a \"test none\" or \"test all\" approach to virologic monitoring. Since viral load monitoring is both important and expensive, testing strategies that reserve virologic testing for those who are at highest risk of treatment failure is critically important to the sustainability of HIV treatment programs in the developing world.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigator: Abstract: This project explores the effectiveness and sustainability of two community-based peer educator interventions compared to hospital-based standard care practices. The hospital services a largely Muslim population in northern Nigeria and is a collaborator with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS in Africa (PEPfAR). We have two aims. The first aim is to compare HIV medication adherence between three different interventions: (1) typical HIV care, support and education as offered by the hospital's adherence staff; (2) daily medication reminders via text messaging from peer educators and encouragement and observation of daily adherence by a home-based treatment coach; or (3) activities as mentioned in 2 plus home visits by peer educators via motorcycle. The second aim is to determine how sustainable these interventions are by evaluating the patient's continuity in the program and their clinical, virologic and immunologic improvement. Since excellent adherence is important from the beginning of treatment, we will target those HIV-infected adults who have been newly prescribed HIV medications. This study is relevant because aside from anecdotal evidence, few studies have demonstrated that peer educators are effective. We attempt to demonstrate that (1) peer educators who support and guide home-based adherence can significantly improve HIV medication adherence when compared to a facility-based adherence support service, and (2) community-based peer educator outreach models are sustainable in the Nigerian context of low education, high levels of stigma, and limited resources and infrastructure. This will hopefully provide evidence-based data for adjusting HIV treatment adherence standards of care.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Moses Sinkala, M.P.H., Lusaka District Health Abstract: In support of the Zambian national program for HIV/AIDS, we created a comprehensive individual-level database for patient follow-up and program reporting. Now implemented in over 18 sites across the country, this database contains medical information for over 30,000 HIV-infected patients. Because of its original design and objectives, however, we face problems with data completeness and patient outcomes ascertainment. Improvements in both areas are needed to perform meaningful longitudinal analyses. The project will convert our current program database to one suitable for broad epidemiological research. Activities supported by the grant include: (1) improving patient follow-up and outcome ascertainment, (2) enhancing the quality of clinical care, (3) monitoring the quality of data entry, and (4) training young Zambian investigators in medical informatics and data management. Using this enhanced database, we will be able to investigate many relevant issues for HIV/AIDS treatment in Africa, including: As donor and host nations look to assess the impact of HIV treatment programs, we believe this type of population-level information will be critical to the continued support of ART in many parts of Africa.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Eliza A. Bukusi, M.P.H., M.MED., M.B.Ch.B. Anjali Sharma, Sc.D., B.A., Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the association of ART expansion and ART-related beliefs with risky sexual behaviors and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) and HIV in the general population of Kisumu, the municipality with the highest HIV seroprevalence in the country. Similarly, the association of ART expansion and ART-related beliefs with risky sexual behaviors in HIV-infected persons receiving ART will also be explored. We will conduct cross-sectional surveys at baseline and one-year later to assess changes in knowledge and beliefs about ART and the impact of these changes on sexual risk behaviors. Surveys of the general population will be conducted by sampling 20 sentinel clusters within the Municipality of Kisumu. Surveys of HIV positive patients on ART will be conducted at our PEPFAR-funded ART rollout program in Kenya, entitled Family AIDS Care and Education Services (FACES). FACES began delivering comprehensive care to the HIV-affected population in Kisumu in March 2005. Understanding public perceptions of ART and their effects on sexual risk behaviors that lead to an increased risk of STI and HIV is essential for designing prevention interventions that address the changing landscape of HIV with the availability of ART. The results of this study will be widely disseminated throughout Kenya, as well as in international publications, so that our results may guide treatment programs in their efforts to improve incorporation of prevention services into HIV care programs.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: James T. Pfeiffer, Ph.D., M.P.H., Abstract: The overall goal of this study is to define an optimal structure and composition of HAART service delivery teams. The primary study aim is to determine which of three existing models for the structure and composition of service delivery teams results in the most efficient and effective delivery of HAART among Mozambican public-sector health facilities. The secondary study aims are to assess the cost-effectiveness of the different human resource models and establish a patient database for long-term follow-up of clinical response, mortality, and adherence to HAART regimens. This study will compare three models for team composition and management, including 1) a medical-doctor focused model, 2) a mixed approach of medical doctors and mid-level cadres collectively seeing patients and making joint decisions, and 3) a mid-level cadre focused model working under the supervision of medical doctors. Outcomes include efficiency measures, quality of care measures, patient/provider satisfaction, and cost of services provided. The proposed study is expected to provide insight into optimal approaches for designing teams to deliver HAART, directly benefiting Mozambique and other countries working to rapidly, safely and effectively increase HAART coverage with limited human resources.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Kogieleum Naidoo, M.B.Ch.B., Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigator: Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigator: Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Helga Holst, M.D., McCord Hospital Abstract: This two-year operational research program is a collaboration between the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the Enhancing Care Initiative, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine and McCord Hospital. The overall goal of the project is to establish the cost-effectiveness of different models of antiretroviral treatment programs across clinical sites in southern Africa in both urban and rural settings. The aims of this study include comparing the immunological, virological and clinical outcomes of ART under different models of care; estimating the financial and economic cost of providing a comprehensive model of ART at each site; and identifying the incremental costs and cost-effectiveness of differences within models of ART (e.g. doctor-centered approaches versus nurse-centered approaches or urban versus rural approaches to care). To achieve these goals, we will examine the clinical outcomes, financial and economic costs and cost-effectiveness of ART programs at three research sites in KZN Province, South Africa. A secondary but important outcome of this study will be to build monitoring and evaluation capacity at each implementation site, as well as enhanced patient tracking systems. The information generated by this study can contribute to answering questions about the optimal use of human resources and cost-effectiveness of different models of ART more generally, as well as provide opportunities to answer important clinical questions.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: In the case of TB, it has been shown that up to 60% of patients with TB in the Gauteng region of South Africa pass through the inpatient wards of the CHBH at some point during their illness. Inpatient visits carry high costs to the health system, and for many opportunistic infections, high rates of death among inpatients. For instance, inpatient mortality rates in TB patients admitted to CHBH are approximately 20%. Despite a G8 global health target set in Okinawa in 2000 to reduce TB deaths by 50% by 2010, TB deaths are now increasing in South Africa, driven in part by high HIV prevalence. Development of methods to combat extremely high inpatient mortality rates is another important step in the process of improving HIV care in South Africa, and will allow high risk patients to benefit from efforts to improve HIV care and survive to access antiretroviral treatment. In response to the needs identified above, we propose the following: Aim 1: Aim 2: Aim 3: The research proposed in this application stems from needs identified by providers and program managers of the ongoing AIDS care and treatment programs in Soweto. It targets the causes and rates of inpatient usage, and high inpatient mortality rates in TB patients, issues with high impact for HIV-infected patients in the area. Both of these themes seek to use the tools of operational research to gain a better understanding of the problems, such that interventions to address them can be developed and employed. The team is lead by a PI of the PEPFAR-funded HIV programs in Soweto, South Africa, and includes an experienced group of co-investigators and collaborators with clinical and methodological expertise from South Africa, Johns Hopkins, and Harvard, all committed to the success of this project.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: This research project follows our previous study at Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), in Jos, Nigeria, the biggest of the 6 Harvard Track 1.0 PEPFAR sites in Nigeria. At JUTH, we have already preliminarily demonstrated that taking directly observed, community-based antiretroviral therapy appeared to improve adherence and virologic outcomes. In our proposed study, 500 HIV-infected patients at JUTH who initiate combination antiretroviral therapy will be randomized into two adherence strategy intervention groups: 1) community-based, directly observed therapy (D-CART), and 2) patient administered therapy (PAT). The interventions in both groups will be similar, except that patients in the D-CART arm will select a treatment partner (spouse, sibling, other relative or friend) who will directly observe the ingestion of at least one of the daily doses of the antiretroviral regimen, and assist the patient in other adherence promotion activities. The virologic and immunologic responses of patients in both groups will be measured, and the resistance mutations that develop in those who fail treatment will be assessed. This is important because the risk of virologic rebound with resistance appears to be significant among patients who take < 90%=\"\" but=\"\"> 70% of their antiretroviral drugs 1. Thus, it is uncertain which adherence strategy will lead to more resistance as either strategy may lead to adherence rates that fall within the danger zone for resistance development. Most initial regimens in resource-limited settings are based on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and lamivudine, which have low genetic barriers to resistance. Increasing the pool of persons who are informed about HIV treatment, and who are involved in the care of HIV-infected persons, has the potential to greatly benefit society as well as the patients. We will assess whether D-CART has the potential to add to this pool by evaluating changes in the treatment partners' perception of HIV infection, HIV-infected persons, and their potential role in mitigating the epidemic. The specific aims of this study are to:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract:  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Data will be collected from two sources. First, we will extend our existing routine monitoring and evaluation field methods and data collection efforts at Columbia-supported President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPfAR) sites (n=29) in order to combine core HIV care and treatment data on patients across sites, including Mother-to-Child Transmission (MCTC)-Plus sites (n=14). The combined data set will include data on a growing number of patients at 43 sites throughout sub-Saharan Africa (including 26,107 patients, 9,687 (37%) of whom are on ART [8,752 adults and 935 children] as of June, 2005). Second, systematic site assessments will be conducted at the 43 Columbia-supported PEPFAR and MTCT-Plus sites every six months in order to capture information about site-level and contextual factors that may influence HIV care and treatment program outcomes. Data from systematic site assessments will be merged with data on patients receiving care and treatment. Using the final merged dataset with patient-level and site-level/contextual information, we will conduct data analyses to determine the relations between individual-level factors, site-level/contextual factors, and HIV care and treatment program outcomes. Finally, we will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to compare the clinical benefits and costs of various care models using cost estimates collected from a sample of sites during the study period. This work is vital to identifying important programmatic aspects of HIV care and treatment programs for use in planning future programs or improving existing ones. The information gathered as part of this activity will suggest novel interventions or policies, which take into account factors at multiple levels, and could thereby improve care and treatment program outcomes in resource limited settings in the immediate future.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: In this study, we will investigate the reasons for and determinants of long-term patient retention, including the willingness and ability of individual patients to remain in an antiretroviral treatment program and to come to the treatment clinic for scheduled visits beyond the initial 6-month period when the symptoms of HIV/AIDS are diminishing. The study will estimate the rate of ARV patient retention and attrition at public treatment sites in South Africa, describe the main reasons for attrition for patients with different characteristics and receiving care from different types of facilities, and determine whether the probability of dropping out varies with specific patient or clinic characteristics. The study will recruit patients currently receiving antiretroviral therapy at an urban, a semi-urban, and a rural clinic in South Africa to participate in the study. Patients will be interviewed upon recruitment into the study (at baseline) and then followed for at least one year. The baseline questionnaire will focus on issues that are hypothesized to affect retention (e.g. costs, side effects, and stigma). Patients who have dropped out of the program will be located using the contact information collected at the baseline interview and interviewed again to determine reasons for discontinuation. Results of the study will improve the information available for long-term ART program design, patient care, and public sector planning. It will identify the most common reasons for patient attrition and allow better targeting of interventions, indicate whether the therapeutic regimen itself can be improved to promote patient retention, and provide more accurate information on expected numbers of patients in later years of ART rollouts.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: The Uganda-Baylor Children's Center of Excellence (COE) is located on the campus of Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, the result of collaboration between Mulago, the pediatric faculty of Makerere University, and Baylor College of Medicine. The center provides care for over 2,000 children, 600 of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. The center sees approximately 170 children each day for treatment, screening, and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) follow-up. Because it is one of the few places where HIV-infected children can receive care and treatment in Uganda, the center is quickly approaching maximum capacity. As a result, the Uganda-Baylor Children's Center of Excellence has begun to develop linkages with other regional health care facilities in order to refer patients for routine care and follow up. This critically important move to decentralize care for HIV-infected children benefits families by providing care that is closer to the patients' home, builds capacity for care and treatment outside the principal urban clinic, and liberates staff at the Center in Kampala to treat critically ill patients and initiate greater numbers on ART. The proposed study seeks to monitor and evaluate the process of decentralizing pediatric HIV/AIDS care and treatment by examining the impact on the quality of care, the total numbers of children on ART, and health care costs associated with a decentralized system of care. Moreover, this study will elucidate some of the important issues (such as policy, creating linkages, training, etc.) related to the process of decentralizing pediatric HIV/AIDS care.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: This project embodies a unique approach to facilitating the development of electronic assistance in health care driven by moving key information on an appropriate technology base and enhancing peripheral capacity development essential to properly manage HIV/AIDS. The system addresses the challenge of the remote tracking of drugs once dispensed from a central pharmacy using a simple bar-coding system and monitoring this information using the hub pharmacy as an information node. The peripheral activity data will be integrated with central stock and dispensing logs to maintain peripheral drug supply without the need for large peripheral drug stocks. The proposed system will develop central pharmacy stock control, peripheral site stock control, generation of sponsor-required reports and programme evaluation information. Real-time programme evaluations would include dates and numbers of patients initiating therapy, dates and times of drug switches, retention of patient on treatment, adherence (missed prescriptions) and regimen switches.  Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: The long term goal of our group is the development and optimization of an HIV care delivery system that will serve as a model for sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this application is to develop and assess a system which uses non-clinician extenders to provide selected aspects of HIV care in rural western Kenya. The plan is to train persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs) to undertake this role. Our central hypothesis is that PLWAs can be effective members of the health care team and that their involvement in community-based HIV care will facilitate patient access to services and improve outcomes. We base this hypothesis on four years of experience providing HIV care in western Kenya as well as our familiarity with integrating PLWAs into our HIV care system. Our group is uniquely qualified to carry out this work as Dr. Kimaiyo (Co-PI) is the Clinical Director for the AMPATH HIV Clinics affiliated with the Moi Faculty of Health Sciences (MUFHS, Eldoret, Kenya). Dr. Wools-Kaloustian, the PI, has been responsible for clinical protocol development and currently practices in one of the rural clinics.

Kenneth C. Anderson, M.D. Alan M. Gewirtz, M.D. David A. Scheinberg, M.D., Ph.D B   Kenneth C. Anderson, M.D. Dr. Anderson is an independent investigator in the Hematologic Malignancies Disease Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. His research interests include cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating myeloma cell growth and survival and novel immune-based therapies for myeloma. Dr. Anderson graduated from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1977 and trained in internal medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He completed his training in hematology, medical oncology, and tumor immunology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Abstract: Development of Novel Treatment Approaches for Multiple Myeloma Development of Novel Treatment Approaches for Multiple Myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a presently incurable bone marrow cancer which will affect 13,700 new individuals in the U.S. in 1999 and account for 2% of cancer-related deaths. Dr. Anderson has assembled a team of basic and clinical researchers to develop new biologically-based treatment strategies for myeloma. These therapies target not only the tumor cell, but also its bone marrow microenvironment, in order to achieve more complete and selective eradication of myeloma cells, improved disease-free survival for patients, and ultimate cure. Laboratory studies will define factors in the tumor cell itself and its microenvironment, such as increased formation of new blood vessels, which permit myeloma cells to grow and survive in the bone marrow. Basic studies will provide the rationale for novel treatments to selectively inhibit tumor growth, induce tumor cell death, and overcome the ability of tumor cells to resist currently available conventional treatments. Simultaneously, the team will develop methods for enhancing immune responses against myeloma cells in the laboratory. These studies will provide the basis for vaccination treatments to specifically target myeloma cells. The team will also identify and characterize those cells in the immune system which are capable of recognizing and killing myeloma cells. These cells will be expanded in the laboratory and then transfused to patients to provide an alternative form of anti-myeloma therapy.  Alan M. Gewirtz, M.D. Dr. Gewirtz is Professor of Medicine and Pathology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Leader of the Stem Cell Biology and Therapeutics Program in the Cancer Center. He has devoted his career to studies of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis and ways of translating basic scientific discoveries into clinically useful therapies for patients with disorders of blood formation. Dr. Gewirtz received his M.D. and M.A. in microbiology from the State University of New York at Buffalo, which he attended from 1971-76. He completed training in internal medicine at Mt.

After completing clinical and research fellowships at Yale, Dr. Gewirtz was on the faculty of Temple University School of Medicine from 1984-90. Abstract: Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Human Leukemia Nucleic Acid Therapeutics for Human Leukemia. The overall goal of this project is to advance the development of more effective, and less toxic, therapies for human leukemia. The principles learned will hopefully be applicable to a larger spectrum of blood disorders, and perhaps cancer and cardiovascular diseases as well. To accomplish this goal, the program will focus on the use of short strands of nucleic acids (oligonucleotides), the building blocks of all genetic information, to disrupt gene expression in diseased cells. Since a number of genes responsible for causing leukemia have been identified, \"switching off\" these genes with nucleic acid drugs should prove to be a highly effective therapeutic strategy. Such therapy should also prove much less toxic to the patient than chemotherapy and radiation, because it is highly specific for the leukemia cells. To switch off target genes, the flow of genetic instructions will be disrupted at the RNA level. RNA is the \"blueprint\" that a cell reads in order to construct the proteins it needs to live. These \"blueprints\" can be disabled or destroyed by oligonucleotides which bind directly to them, or which attract away proteins that protect the RNA. While often effective in the laboratory, the ability to employ nucleic acid-based therapies in the clinic remains theoretical and unproven. The aims of the program will be to advance the use of oligonucleotide drugs in the clinic by: The most promising oligonucleotides will then be used to initiate Phase I/II clinical studies in leukemic patients.  David A. Scheinberg, M.D., Ph.D Dr. Scheinberg is Attending and Chief of the Leukemia Service at Memorial Hospital and Member and Head of the Hematopoietic Cancer Immunochemistry Laboratory at Sloan-Kettering Institute. His work is focused on the discovery of new cancer immunotherapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, and the testing of them in clinical trials in patients with cancer. Dr. Scheinberg holds an appointment in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics and Department of Medicine at Cornell Medical College and is an advisor to several charitable foundations and companies developing new strategies for treatment of patients with cancer. He is a former Scholar of the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust and a translational investigator of the Leukemia Society of America. Abstract: Specific Immunotherapy of Cancer: Targeting Therapy Selectively to the Neoplastic Cell Specific Immunotherapy of Cancer: Targeting Therapy Selectively to the Neoplastic Cell. The program proposes to harness the immune system to specifically kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells and tissues. Two strategies will be employed. In the first, monoclonal antibodies (proteins of the immune system that can target cancer cells) will be used to deliver highly potent radioactive particles directly to cancer cells to kill them. These particles, known as alpha particles, are extraordinarily powerful, yet travel such short distances that they do not damage normal cells and tissues in the vicinity of the cancer. The second approach aims to develop vaccines that will stimulate the patient's immune system to recognize abnormal cancer-causing proteins found exclusively in the cancer cells. The aim is to have the cells of the immune system selectively attack and kill those cancer cells that have these proteins while sparing normal cells. At the current time, this program is the only one worldwide to use these two strategies in people.  Bruce D. Walker, M.D. Dr. Walker is Director of the Partners AIDS Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. His work focuses on efforts to boost immunity in HIV-1 infected people in order to gain immunologic containment of the virus. Dr. Walker graduated from Case Western University School of Medicine in 1980. Following an internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, he completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Robert T. Schooley, studying the cellular response to HIV in infected people.

Abstract: Immunogenetic Rheostats of HIV-1 Transmission, Keys for Vaccine Development Not all subjects are equally susceptible to acquiring HIV infection and once infected, individuals differ in their rate of progression to AIDS. There is increasing evidence that intersubject differences in HIV-AIDS susceptibility are in part dictated by genetic changes. Dr. Ahuja will investigate host genes that influence variable HIV-AIDS susceptibility and this information will help provide insights into the correlates of protection and, in turn this might help in the design and evaluation of HIV vaccines.  Marcus Altfeld, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Altfeld is the Director of the Program for Innate Immunity at the Partners AIDS Research Center (PARC) and the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and is an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. He received his M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in Germany in 1997, and subsequently worked as a Resident in the Department of Medicine at the University of Bonn. After receiving his Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (DTM&H) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he joined PARC as a research fellow in 1999, and became a member of the faculty in 2001. Dr. Altfeld's research is directed towards the characterization of innate and adaptive immunity in viral infections, with focus on acute HIV-1 and Influenza infection. The aim of this research is to understand the correlates of protective immunity in viral infections, and in particular, how the initial activation of the innate immune system by pathogens shapes the quality of the adaptive immunity. The long term goal is to harness innate immunity for the development of protective vaccines. Dr. Altfeld's laboratory maintains close collaborations with the HIV-1 Pathogenesis Program at the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine, University of KwaZulu Natal, in Durban, South Africa; and the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Tangdu Hospital, 4th Military Medical School, in Xi'an, China, where he also serves as a Visiting Professor. Dr. Altfeld is as a member of the American Association of Clinical Investigation, the NIH Plan for HIV-1 Related Research Etiology and Pathogenesis Planning Group (FY 2006-2009), the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research Executive Committee, and the Harvard Medical School Immunology Graduate Program. Abstract: Innate Immunity in HIV-1 Infection Current efforts to develop an HIV-1 vaccine have failed, and basic research beyond traditionally studied adaptive HIV-1-specific immunity is required to identify the immune correlates of protection against HIV-1. The first line of defense against infections consists of a highly organized innate immune response, and the aims of the proposed research program are to define the mechanisms by which the innate immune system senses HIV-1, contributes to the control of viral replication, and influences the function of the subsequently developing adaptive immune response. In response to the identified needs to facilitate translation of advances in the understanding of the human innate immune system's involvement in the control of HIV-1 infection into clinical practice, Dr. Altfeld has built an Innate Immunity Program between MGH in Boston and the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. The program is aimed at training physician-scientists in the evolving field of innate viral immunity, and at translating laboratory research advances into clinical trials that will evaluate interventions targeting the innate immune system to enhance anti-HIV immunity. The specific hypotheses addressed in this research program are: The Doris Duke award will also support research training for medical students and young physician-scientists to work with Dr. Altfeld and his team both at Harvard Medical School and at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa.  Jayakrishna Ambati, M.D. Dr. Ambati is Professor of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences and Professor of Physiology at the University of Kentucky School of Medicine. He serves as Vice Chair of the Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences and holds the Dr. E. Vernon Smith & Eloise C. Smith Endowed Chair in Macular Degeneration Research. Dr. Ambati was born and raised in India, the elder son of Prof. A. Muralimohan Rao, an Indian Institute of Technology-educated mathematician, and Gomathi Rao, a scholar in Tamil literature. He secured his electrical engineering degree at The Johns Hopkins University at the age of 17, and M.D. (magna cum laude) from SUNY Health Science Center at Brooklyn. Following ophthalmology residency at the University of Rochester and retina fellowship at Harvard Medical School, he joined the University of Kentucky in 2001. Dr. Ambati seeks to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects 10 million Americans, and to develop novel therapeutics to prevent and treat this blinding condition. His laboratory has made fundamental discoveries about AMD pathogenesis and the immune pathways that trigger both the atrophic and neovascular forms of this disease. They also discovered an unexpected intersection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) activity, an anti-viral immune receptor, and blood vessel growth that has profound implications for clinical application of siRNA therapeutics. In collaboration with his brother, Dr. Balamurali Ambati, a cornea surgeon and vascular biologist, he answered one of the foremost questions in vascular biology: how does the cornea remain avascular? His laboratory has published several articles in such journals as Nature, Nature Medicine, and the New England Journal of Medicine, and is supported by the National Eye Institute of NIH. Dr. Ambati is a Clinical Scholar in Translational Research of the Burroughs Wellcome Fund. He received the Physician Scientist Award and the Lew R. Wasserman Merit Award from Research to Prevent Blindness, the Dennis W. Jahnigen Career Development Award from The American Geriatrics Society, and a Career Development Award from The Foundation Fighting Blindness. The University of Kentucky awarded Dr. Ambati the Albert D. and Elizabeth H. Kirwan Memorial Prize and named him a University Research Professor. He is on the Editorial Board of Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science and has been elected a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation. He lives with his wife Kameshwari, an IIT-educated chemist, and their daughters Meenakshi and Vidya Lakshmi in Lexington, Kentucky. Abstract: Short Non-Interfering RNAs as Novel Therapies for Age-related Macular Degeneration Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), is the leading of blindness among the elderly in most industrialized nations, and affects as many Americans as all cancers combined. It results in vision loss either through invasion of abnormal blood vessels into the retina (choroidal neovascularization) or via death of retinal cells (geographic atrophy). Dr. Ambati's laboratory has identified a critical role for toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3), an anti-viral immune receptor that recognized double stranded RNAs, in both geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization. The aim of this project is to develop therapeutics for both forms of the disease by either activating or inhibiting TLR3. In tandem, Dr. Ambati seeks to train a new generation of physician-scientists with translational interests in angiogenesis research.  Arul M. Chinnaiyan, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Chinnaiyan is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, the S.P. Hicks Endowed Professor of Pathology and Professor of Pathology and Urology at the University of Michigan Medical School, and is also a member of the Comprehensive Cancer Center and Bioinformatics Program. In 2007, he was named the Director of a new initiative at the University called the Michigan Center for Translational Pathology (MCTP), the goal of which is to develop new molecular tests and therapeutics for human disease with a primary focus on cancer. Dr. Chinnaiyan is a board certified Clinical Pathologist and currently serves as Director of the Division of Pathology Research Informatics and Director of Cancer Bioinformatics. In addition to receiving his undergraduate degree and medical training at Michigan, he received his Ph.D. in Pathology and has made seminal contributions to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of how cells die (a process called apoptosis). Dr. Chinnaiyan has received a number of awards including the Basic Science Research Award awarded by the University of Michigan Medical School Dean's Office, the AMGEN Outstanding Investigator Award, the Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, the Burroughs Welcome Foundation Award in Clinical Translational Research, the 2006 Benjamin Castleman Award, the 2007 Ramzi Cotran Young Investigator Award and was recently appointed as an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Chinnaiyan was also elected as a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation. Dr. Chinnaiyan's laboratory has focused on functional genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics approaches to study cancer for the purposes of understanding cancer biology as well as to discover clinical biomarkers. He and his collaborators have characterized a number of biomarkers of prostate cancer including AMACR, EZH2 and hepsin. AMACR is being used clinically across the country in the assessment of cancer in prostate needle biopsies. The landmark study thus far from Dr. Chinnaiyan's laboratory is the discovery of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions prostate cancer. TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions are specific markers of prostate cancer as well as presumably function as rational targets for this disease. This finding potentially redefines the molecular basis of prostate cancer as well as other common epithelial cancers. The team involved with these studies recently was awarded the 2007 AACR Team Science Award. His laboratory is currently looking for ways to target this gene fusion as well as discover similar gene fusions in other common epithelial tumors such as those derived from the breast, lung, and colon. His laboratory also developed the popular cancer profiling bioinformatics resource called Oncomine (www.oncomine.org) which is freely available to the academic community (hosting nearly 10,000 registered users from over 30 countries). Abstract: Searching for Recurrent Gene Fusions and Translocations in Common Solid Tumors The goal of this project is to launch a new effort in the Chinnaiyan laboratory to comprehensively and systematically scour common human solid tumors for the presence of recurrent gene arrangements known as gene fusions. Once a recurrent gene fusion is identified, it becomes a prime candidate for being a specific biomarker for a tumor type as well as a rational therapeutic target. The Chinnaiyan lab currently has an established program to discover these gene fusions in prostate cancer. We will develop a translational scientist training program to establish gene fusion discovery efforts in breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer, among others. To accomplish our goal, we will need to develop and orchestrate novel, high-throughput technologies to search the genome of hundreds of tumors. High-throughput screening allows a researcher to quickly conduct millions of biochemical, genetic or pharmacological tests. Through this process one can quickly identify genes which modulate a particular biomolecular pathway. The ultimate goal is to translate the findings into the clinical impact of developing a prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target.  Terrie Inder, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Inder is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology, and Radiology as well as Neonatal Clinician at St. Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University. She is noted as author, lecturer, and researcher in the field of the newborn brain. She was born and educated in New Zealand. She graduated with her Bachelor in Medicine and Bachelor in Surgery from the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand as the top graduate in her class. Dr. Inder completed her Residency in Pediatrics and Fellowship in Newborn Medicine in New Zealand as well as her Ph.D. in \"Free Radical Mediated Injury in the Newborn\" before undertaking a second residency in child neurology at Children's Hospital in Boston. She now leads an internationally recognized research team defining the timing of brain injury in premature and term born babies developing new technologies and interventions to improve long- term outcomes in high-risk infants. An increasing number of at-risk preterm and sick term born infants survive with high rates of neurodevelopmental disability. In order to apply rational neuroprotective strategies her laboratory aims to define the timing and nature of injury at which to target such interventions as well as the impact of such injury on subsequent cerebral development. This is achieved with a large number of parallel clinical studies in a large 80 bed neonatal intensive care unit based at St. Louis Children's Hospital utilizing bedside technologies such as electroencephalography, optical tomography alongside advanced state of the art magnetic resonance imaging techniques in both the preterm and term born at risk infant. A multidisciplinary team of neonatal attendings, neurologists, radiologists, fellows, M.D./Ph.D. students, occupational therapists, research assistants and research nurses contribute to studies such as the impact of hypothermia and seizures on the injured brain, nature and timing of injury in the preterm brain, the impact of reservoir drainage in post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and the potential neuroprotective effect of maternal pomegranate. Dr. Inder is supported by the NIH with multiple R01 awards and is devoted to the training of the next generation of clinical investigators in her field. Abstract: Understanding Brain Injury and Development in at Risk Infants to Improve Outcomes Preterm birth is a major public-health challenge because of its increasing incidence combined with frequent occurrence of subsequent behavioral, neurological, and psychiatric challenges faced by surviving infants. To date, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the poor outcomes in these infants remain poorly understood. Neural progenitor or stem cells (NPCs) are known to reside in two regions of the developing brain— the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus with the ability to produce new brain cells including neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vivo and in vitro. This raises the potential of their role in recovery following brain injury. This potential may be even greater in the immature brain of an infant but has not yet been evaluated. Thus, we propose to apply complementary magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approaches to detect and quantify the presence of the progenitor or native stem cell region within the preterm infant from shortly after birth until discharge from the hospital several months later. This will be carried out alongside complimentary advanced structural MR imaging to evaluate brain injury and development. The study design with repeated MR imaging of the infants throughout the infant's course in the intensive care unit will allow characterization of the relationship of this region to both structural abnormalities and compensatory changes in response to early brain injury, perinatal exposures and intensive care therapies. The presence and extent of the progenitor cell region will also be related to neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood. If successful, the proposed studies will engender a deeper understanding of the innate neural recovery in the immature brain with in-vivo MR biomarkers of NPC region and its impact on subsequent regional brain structure and neurodevelopmental outcome. These data will assist in providing new understanding of neural recovery and strategies for improving outcomes in preterm infants. In addition, the MR techniques will be capable of being applied in-vivo to any infants at-risk of brain injury or altered brain development.  Eric Vilain, M.D., Ph.D. Eric Vilain, M.D., Ph.D. was born in Paris, France, and earned his M.D. from the Paris Children's Hospital Necker, his Ph.D. from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, then completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Medical Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is Professor of Human Genetics, Pediatrics and Urology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, the Chief of Medical Genetics in the Department of Pediatrics and the Director of the Center for Gender-Based Biology. Dr. Vilain's laboratory explores the genetics of sexual development, focusing on the molecular mechanisms of gonad development, as well as on the genetic determinants of brain sexual differentiation. He has identified a large number of mutations in sex-determining genes, developed animal models with atypical sexual development, and identified genes differentially expressed between male and female fetal mouse brains. Dr. Vilain currently works at three projects: the genetics of Disorders of Sex Development (intersexuality), the genetics of sexual orientation and gender identity, and the biological bases of sex differences in susceptibility to diseases, particularly for Parkinson's disease and hypertension. His research program has been continuously supported by several grants from the NIH, and he has published extensively in the field of sexual development. He is a Fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics, and a member of numerous professional committees, including those related to the care of intersex individuals. Abstract: Disorders of Sex Development Disorders of sex development (DSD) encompass a very large spectrum of phenotypes, from minor malformations of the genitalia (hypospadias, cryptorchidism, hypertrophy of the clitoris) to sexual ambiguity. Taken altogether, these anomalies have an estimated frequency of 0.5% to 1%. Understanding the pathophysiology of disorders of sex development has clinical consequences in terms of fertility (most patients are sterile), cancer (most patients carry a higher risk of gonadal tumor) and sexual dysfunction (most patients suffer from sexuality issues).", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": null, "_award_schema_version": "0.1.0"}

Transport Support to Improve ARV Treatment Outcomes  Transport Support to Improve ARV Treatment Outcomes Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Behavioral Outcomes. We will determine the impact of transportation assistance on reducing treatment interruptions. To determine whether transportation assistance is associated with fewer treatment interruptions, we will compare total days of interrupted therapy, number of 48 hour treatment interruptions, and pharmacy refill behavior between the two groups. To determine whether transportation assistance is associated with HIV viral load suppression, we will compare HIV viral load between the two groups. To determine whether transportation assistance improves the economic output, we will examine the effects of transportation assistance on labor supply, household consumption, child labor and schooling hours, and loans received in order to determine the full benefit of transportation assistance.  Macronutrient Supplement for HIV-Infected Patients Initiating ART Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: We propose a study to determine whether HIV-infected patients with BMI <18.5 who are initiating ART and multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) as per national guidelines will have improved nutritional, clinical, immunologic outcomes as well as improvement in performance status and quality of life measures with specific food supplementation. The study will be conducted at two health facilities in Central Province in Kenya. One site will receive ART, the food supplement and MMS while the other will receive standard of care (ART play MMS). The primary outcome will be change in BMI from baseline to 12 months i.e. 6 months after completion of nutrition supplementation to determine durability of any effect. Secondary outcomes will include change in measures of body composition, mortality, clinical outcomes, CD4 cell count, performance status, quality of life and changes in nutritional blood parameters. There is an urgent need to define the influence of nutritional status on patient outcomes in the context of use of ART in resource-limited settings. Findings from the proposed study can have a substantial impact on the management of individual patients and can serve to guide national policy.  Impact and Value of Improving TB Control in Africa Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: This project will examine the value and impact of improving TB case detection and implementing measures to reduce transmission. We will use a state-transition, computer simulation model to project the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of improving TB infection control in an area of high HIV prevalence with the following 3 aims: To carry out these aims, we will use data from the South African PEPFAR site in Cape Town to inform the analysis using the “Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications” (CEPAC) International model, a widely published, detailed state-transition model of HIV infection. This proposal will benefit from the rich collaborative ties established between investigators in Cape Town and in Boston in addressing the value of rapid TB detection and control in the context of the dual epidemics of HIV and TB disease.  Combating MDR and XDR TB in Rural South Africa Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: We propose in this project to develop and evaluate a three part strategy to reduce the prevalence, transmission and consequences of drug resistant tuberculosis among HIV co-infected patients in rural South Africa: This project is based upon and will expand our success in introducing antiretroviral therapy to HIV/TB co-infected patients, and will be undertaken by an established collaborative US and South African research team with investigators at Yale University and Albert Einstein College of Medicine and at a district hospital and NGO, Philanjalo, in rural KwaZulu-Natal, province, the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine and Doris Duke Medical Research Institute in Durban and with the support of the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health. The proposed project has potential for benefit both at the local level in KwaZulu-Natal and in the many resource limited settings worldwide where TB and HIV are highly prevalent.  Impact of Peer Educators and Mobile Phones on HIV Care Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Building on this initial experience, we will conduct a three arm, cluster-randomized trial of the impact on HIV care of peer educators, with and without mobile phones (intervention arms A and B), compared to a control arm in rural Rakai District, Uganda. The peer educators will be supported with a Warmline toll-free service staffed by clinicians experienced in HIV care. The primary endpoints will be virologic treatment failure and antiretroviral (ARV) adherence over one year. The hypotheses are that compared to control communities, peer educators will reduce treatment failures and improve ARV adherence, and mobile phones used by peer educators will more rapidly address adherence and clinical problems, resulting in lower treatment failures. If, as is anticipated, the peer educator/mobile phone interventions reduce treatment failure and improve adherence, during the second year of the proposed project we will scale up these interventions in all communities while maintaining post-trial monitoring to evaluate effectiveness.  Trial of Strategies to Enroll Pregnant Women into ART Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: The urban district of Lusaka, Zambia has large, well-established programs for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) and for HIV care and treatment. All pregnant women are routinely offered HIV testing in antenatal care, with an option to opt out of testing. In our setting, pregnant women identified as HIV-positive are offered routine CD4 count screening and assessed for clinical signs of treatment eligibility. Those who are identified as eligible for treatment according to national guidelines are then brought by peer educators to the HIV care clinic. To date, this strategy has succeeded in starting HAART in pregnancy in approximately 21% of women identified as treatment-eligible. In order to increase the number of eligible pregnant women who start HAART in pregnancy, the Lusaka District has decided to begin providing HIV care within the antenatal clinics. This service will be rolled out in phases. Through the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation's ORACTA grant, we will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated HIV care in the antenatal clinic as a strategy for starting treatment-eligible pregnant women on HAART. Our primary aim is to evaluate whether providing HIV care in the antenatal clinic increases the percentage of treatment-eligible pregnant women initiating HAART during pregnancy. HIV care will be introduced in eight antenatal clinics in a phased roll out over a 10 month period. We will determine the percentage of treatment eligible women initiating HAART in all antenatal clinics at baseline and after introduction of integrated HIV care. Because antenatal clinics will initiate integrated HIV care at different time points, we will be able to account for whether enrollment into care is improving over time. The secondary aims of this study are to evaluate whether women initiate HAART earlier in pregnancy when it is provided in the antenatal clinic; to evaluate adherence to therapy for each strategy by measuring patient retention in the program and timeliness of pharmacy pick-ups; and to evaluate the incremental cost per patient commenced on therapy with the antenatal HIV care strategy.  Evaluating Two Models of ART Delivery in Rural Rwanda Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: We will pursue the following primary aims: A prospective observational cohort of patients initiating ART in two rural areas, one that utilizes the standard model of ART care in Rwanda and one that uses the more comprehensive model of care, will be defined and longitudinally followed. Patients at both sites will undergo standardized clinical, laboratory, adherence and psychosocial evaluations. Adherence will be assessed via unannounced pill counts and self-reports after three, six, and twelve months of ART. Indirect benefits, such as changes in work and school attendance, and changes in health seeking behavior, will be measured through standardized questionnaires administered at six-month intervals.  Mobile ARV Pharmacy at TREAT Sites in Rural Uganda Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract:  Improving TB Diagnosis in High HIV Primary Care Settings Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: This research project will assess the effectiveness of a standardized diagnostic algorithm to evaluate a patient with cough or difficulty breathing. The algorithm uses simple laboratory tests commonly available in primary health centers and basic physical examination skills, and can be performed by a nurse. Study patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of a busy district hospital in Lesotho, where much of the patient population has HIV, TB and other respiratory illnesses. The patients will first be assessed by a nurse who will use the algorithm to make a diagnosis. The results of this algorithm will then be compared to a \"gold standard\" of a physician using a full set of diagnostic tests, including chest x-ray and TB culture. The results of this study are expected to be relevant to the many thousands of primary health centers in sub-Saharan Africa.  Community-Based Case Finding of TB-HIV Patients Principal Investigator: Co-Investigators: Abstract: Before 2003, the management of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis was simply to treat the tuberculosis because effective ways to treat HIV were not yet widely available in Africa. After 2003, with the financial commitments from the Presidential Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPfAR) and the Global Fund of the World Bank, there has been a rapid expansion of services to provide life-saving antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV. Health care professionals in Africa now have the means to treat their HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis. The ability to treat HIV and tuberculosis together requires a proper diagnosis of both diseases. Early diagnosis of patients with both HIV and tuberculosis is imperative for it can reduce mortality and prevent further spread of these diseases to other people. Currently, most tuberculosis control programs around the world rely on passive case finding to detect new cases of tuberculosis. In passive case finding, tuberculosis patients are identified at clinics or hospitals after the patient has decided to seek care. Our preliminary research in Kampala, Uganda, has shown that passive case finding is associated with unnecessary delays in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV and tuberculosis. The premise of our proposal is that active case finding will improve case detection of tuberculosis, identify cases at an earlier point in their disease, and will enhance detection of HIV-infected cases because of the tight link between HIV and tuberculosis. But active case finding can take many forms. Since the optimal form for accessing HIV-associated tuberculosis is unknown, we will evaluate two innovative community-based approaches to enhance early entry into an integrated care program for HIV and tuberculosis. In one approach, we will look for tuberculosis and HIV infection in the household contacts of infectious tuberculosis cases; in the other approach, we will look for tuberculosis and HIV infection in people with a cough lasting more than two weeks, identified in a door-to-door survey. With this information, we will be able to compare the effectiveness of each method to identify early tuberculosis cases and to compare the cost(s) of detecting one case of HIV and tuberculosis in the community. The findings of this study will inform policy about the effectiveness of active case finding in national tuberculosis programs where HIV is common.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": null, "_award_schema_version": "0.1.0"}

Fisher, M.D., Ph.D. Biography David Fisher was born in Highland Park, New Jersey to a scientist father and musician mother. He graduated from Swarthmore College (Biology & Chemistry) and the Curtis Institute of Music (cello) and subsequently obtained his Ph.D. at Rockefeller University and M.D. at Cornell Medical College. His Ph.D. work was carried out with Henry Kunkel and Gunter Blobel on the topic of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and recognition by auto-antibodies (cell biology & immunology). Fisher completed residency training in Internal Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, followed by specialization in Adult Oncology and Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School. He carried out postdoctoral research training with Dr. Philip Sharp at the Center for Cancer Research at MIT before joining the Harvard Medical School faculty in 1993 in the Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology. In this capacity he continues to treat Pediatric Oncology patients, teach graduate and medical students, and lead a basic science research group with a focus on the interface between clinical oncology and molecular medicine. Dr. Fisher's research has focused on the process of gene transcription, an event which underlies normal growth as well as disease states. He is renowned for his studies on development of melanocytes, the cells in skin which make pigment as well as the analysis of mechanisms which regulate the process of cell death. His work has had major impact in the field of melanoma biology, and Dr. Fisher recently became Director of the Melanoma Program in Medical Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School. His research related to the Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award involves novel therapeutic and prevention strategies for melanoma. Dr. Fisher has received numerous honors and awards including the Gertrude B. Elion Award for Cancer Research from the American Association for Cancer Research, the Pew Foundation Scholars Award, the American Society of Hematology Scholar Award, and the McDonnell Foundation Research Scholar Award. He also sits on the council of multiple biomedical foundations including the William Guy Forbeck Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation, the Melanoma Research Foundation, and the American Society of Clinical Investigation. He lives with his wife Claire Fung (physician, Harvard Medical School) and their four children in Newton, MA. Abstract Novel Strategies for Treatment and Prevention of Melanoma The incidence of melanoma is rising more steeply than any other malignancy in man. However, therapeutic success beyond early detection remains very limited. Despite this enormous challenge, several recent key discoveries have been made which suggest mechanism-based new strategies to confront this terrible disease. These findings include work from multiple labs, including ours, and involve breakthroughs in our understanding of pathways which regulate melanocyte growth and survival, production of UV-protective pigmentation, and signals from neighboring cells and the environment which govern melanocyte responsiveness or autonomous growth. A particularly important discovery is the observation that approximately two-thirds of melanomas harbor an identical activating mutation in the BRAF kinase. We have shown that this mutation effectively hijacks signaling pathways which are normally under tight homeostatic control, resulting in both predictable (MAPK) and unpredictable (BCL-family) anti-apoptotic consequences. These discoveries carry exciting opportunities for direct translation into patient-directed clinical interventions. This proposal focuses specifically on this translation, with sections devoted to both melanoma prevention and treatment. The first Aim is based upon our finding that it is possible to mimic the specific pathway of UV-induced pigmentation through use of a topical small molecule agonist. This strategy stands to offer clinical benefit for melanoma prevention. Aim 2 is a Kinome Sequencing study, in which primary melanoma specimens will be subjected to complete exon sequencing of all known kinase genes. BRAF mutations occur very early in melanomagenesis, based on their frequency in benign moles. Additional mutational events are extremely likely to accompany progression to invasive cancer. While such mutations may or may not reside within kinase genes, the kinases are particularly drug-able targets, and we wish to utilize a newly established intrastructure at our Institute to carry out this search. Aim 3 focuses on the clinical application of a new BRAF inhibitor drug, which we have collaborated in the development of with a large pharmaceutical company. Laboratory correlative studies will accompany this clinical analysis. Aim 4 examines clinical targeting of CDK2, a kinase which was found to exhibit distinct functional importance in melanoma (vs. other tumors) due to the localization of the CDK2 gene to a pigment gene genomic locus. Finally, as newly named Director of Melanoma in the Department of Medical Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, I focus this proposal on building a broad, interdisciplinary Melanoma Program, bringing together clinicians from multiple specialties with lab-based physician scientists, to promote mentoring and bench-to-bedside research.  Sanjiv S. Gambhir, M.D., Ph.D. Biography Sanjiv Sam Gambhir is a Professor of Radiology and Bio-X at Stanford University. He is the Head of Nuclear Medicine and Director of the Molecular Imaging Program at Stanford (MIPS). He trained at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Scientist Training Program, where he obtained both his M.D. and Ph.D. He completed his Medicine and Nuclear Medicine training at UCLA and was a Professor of Molecular Pharmacology, Vice-chair of Molecular & Medical Pharmacology and Director of the Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging before moving to Stanford University in 2003. Dr. Gambhir, his wife Aruna and six-year-old son Milan live in Portola Valley, California.

Abstract Molecular Imaging of Cancer with a Voltage Sensor My laboratory has been bridging the fields of biomedical imaging with cell/molecular biology, oncology, molecular pharmacology, and chemistry in order to advance molecular imaging of cancer in living subjects. My lab has developed several assays which allow for imaging of cell surface receptors, intracellular enzymes, and reporter genes in living subjects including humans. Through use of technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) it is becoming increasingly possible to monitor events related to cancer progression and efficacy of anti-cancer therapies. The next generation of imaging tools/assays should allow for customized imaging in which specific imaging agents are available for each individual based on their underlying molecular abnormalities. In the current proposal, I would like to test in human volunteers and cancer patients a new class of imaging probe that accumulates in cancer cells that have up-regulated their mitochondrial membrane potential. Many types of cancer are currently imaged with 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) which measures glucose utilization in tumors. 18F-FDG has limitations due to poor uptake by several tumor types and reduced specificity due to accumulation in inflammatory tissues, skeletal muscle, bowel, as well as many normal tissues which depend on glucose. My lab has recently validated that a Fluorine-18 labeled tetraphenylphosphonium analog (18F-TPP) can accumulate very well in many tumor types, that this accumulation is correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential, and has excellent pharmacokinetics because it clears from blood and other tissues very rapidly. Furthermore 18F-TPP has almost no uptake in inflammatory tissues and bowel, which should lead to a much better specificity than 18F-FDG. In the current proposal we will test 18F-TPP with PET in human volunteers for stability, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry (Aim 1). Subsequently we will test 18F-TPP against 18F-FDG in patients with rising CEA levels and GI malignancies to determine its ability to outperform 18F-FDG (Aim 2). Finally, we will compare 18F-TPP and 18F-FDG in predicting response to treatment in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Robert S. Negrin, M.D. Biography Robert S.

He is currently the Director of the Bone Marrow Transplant Program at Stanford University and Medical Director for the Stanford Cell Therapeutics Laboratory. Abstract Regulatory T Cells in Bone Marrow Transplantation Regulation of the immune response holds great promise for the treatment of a variety of clinical conditions. In hematopoietic cell transplantation the transfer of immunity from donor to recipient is capable of curing malignancy in a reaction termed the graft vs tumor (GVT) effect. Equally potent and clinically dangerous is graft vs host disease (GVHD), which is the major limitation to successful allogeneic transplantation and limits the use of this treatment approach to patients with life threatening malignancies. Animal studies have clearly demonstrated that allogeneic hermatopoietic cell transplantation is capable of curing autoimmune disorders and enhances the survival of transplanted organs in the setting where GVHD can be controlled. Therefore, strategies, which are capable of controlling GVHD yet allow for GVT reactions, hold great promise in clinical medicine. In this proposal we will directly extend our recently discovered findings that a naturally present population of regulatory T cells with the defined cell surface phenotype of CD4+ CD25+ are capable of controlling GVHD in animal models across major histocompatibility barriers. Importantly, the Treg cells did not inhibit GVT effects. Further experimentation has demonstrated that the mechanism of this effect is due to the ability of the Treg to control proliferation of alloreactive conventional T cells which upon activation and expansion cause GVHD. In the presence of Treg alloreactive T cells still become activated which allows for GVT reactions, yet prevention of massive T cell expansion controls GVHD. An analogous population of human Treg cells with very similar properties with respect to cell surface phenotype and function can be found in the blood. In this proposal we will directly extend our bench results to the bedside where we will isolate, characterize and transplant highly defined populations of conventional and regulatory T cells. In the first Specific Aim, we will focus on the characterization and expansion of human Treg cells. We have developed a novel assay of cytotoxicity which will allow for the probing of effects of Treg cells on conventional T cell activation, expansion and cytotoxic function. We will explore the impact of freshly isolated and expanded Treg cells on the activity of conventional T cells in these assays and probe specific molecules using molecular and cellular biological techniques to explore mechanisms. In the second Specific Aim, we will directly extend these findings to the clinic where we will isolate pure populations of Treg cells with high speed cell sorting and pursue allogeneic transplantation in patients with malignancies. These studies will define both the biological and clinical activity of this unique population of T cells with immune regulatory function.  Philip J. Rosenthal, M.D. Biography Dr. Rosenthal is a Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He is a member of the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, the Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases, and the Global Health Sciences Program at UCSF. He also directs a Fogarty International Center UCSF/Makerere University Training Grant for the training of African clinician scientists in malaria research. Dr. Rosenthal received a B.S. in Biochemistry from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and an M.D. from New York University. He then trained in Medicine at the University of Michigan and in Infectious Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. He also served as a consultant for the World Health Organization. Dr. Rosenthal's research interests focus on malaria, including basic science, clinical, and translational research. Basic science studies include the characterization of a family of parasite cysteine proteases that includes promising targets for new antimalarial drugs. In collaboration with chemistry collaborators, his group is now pursuing drug discovery directed against cysteine proteases. Another project is exploring antibiotics as antimalarial drugs. Dr. Rosenthal's group also evaluates the clinical and molecular epidemiology of malaria, with studies based in Uganda. These studies include clinical trials of new antimalarial agents and drug combinations, evaluations of the roles of parasite and host genetic polymorphisms in drug resistance, considerations of the importance of the complexity of malaria infections, and studies of molecular mechanisms of drug resistance. Dr. Rosenthal is on the editorial boards of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. He has received an NIH Physician Scientist Award and was an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association. He receives research funding from the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Medicines for Malaria Venture. Abstract Translational Studies of Antimalarial Drug Resistance Malaria is one of the greatest infectious disease problems in the world, and its control is severely limited by drug resistance. A better understanding of mechanisms of antimalarial drug resistance is greatly needed, but few groups are equipped to perform the translational studies needed to answer many key questions. We have been engaged in basic malaria research since the late 1980s and in clinical studies of antimalarial drug efficacy and resistance in Uganda since the late 1990s. This project will bridge our ongoing basic science and clinical malaria research programs to perform translational studies of antimalarial drug resistance. Tied to our research will be a major training effort, with mentoring of American junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and medical students and Ugandan junior scientists in translational malaria research. The broad objectives of our program will be to perform cutting edge translational research on malaria, primarily focusing on antimalarial drug resistance, to support the development of American clinical scientists with expertise in translational malaria research, and to support the development of African clinical scientists. In this research project we will test the hypotheses that the rate of antimalarial drug resistance development is dependent on the complexity and diversity of infections, that resistance develops due both to the migration of resistant clones and the spontaneous selection of resistant mutants, and that specific molecular mechanisms of resistance can be identified using modern molecular techniques. Our specific aims will be as follows: (1) Assessment of associations between the complexity and diversity of malaria infections and treatment outcomes. We will use samples from prior and ongoing clinical studies in Uganda to test the hypothesis that increased parasite complexity in an individual and diversity in a community favors the selection of drug-resistant parasites. (2) Characterization of the selection of drug resistant malaria parasites. We will study laboratory isolates selected for resistance and isolates from patients with sensitive and resistant clinical outcomes to study the steps that lead to the elaboration of antimalarial drug resistance, in particular the relative contributions of migration of resistant clones into a community and the spontaneous selection of resistant parasites in an individual.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": null, "_award_schema_version": "0.1.0"}

Such cells can be recognized by their capacity to multiply rapidly when extracted from the blood and allowed to grow under specific conditions. Specifically, we have hypothesized that such vascular progenitor cells would be much less abundant in the blood of individuals with advanced atherosclerosis, when compared to individuals with nearly intact heart arteries (as evidenced by studying these arterial conduits with specialized X-ray techniques). Furthermore, we also plan to look at the ability of another type of progenitor cells that can be found in the cord blood of newborns, to prevent the development of atherosclerosis and consequent heart disease in children that have a particular pre-disposition for developing atherosclerosis because of what we call inherited metabolic disorders, and in particular, Hurler syndrome. The long-term goal of our study is not only to eradicate atherosclerosis, but also and as a consequence, to prolong healthy life and perhaps life itself for many human beings. Such progress may create fundamental societal and ethical issues that we are planning to address from the start of performing these experiments. With such approach, we intend to bring our scientific breakthroughs in an environment where harmony can be maintained between science, philosophy, and spirituality.  A Humanoid Robot as an Interactive Diagnostic Device in Autism Team Leader: Key Investigators: Team Disciplines: Abstract: In our studies to date, children watch social situations on a screen while we measure what they are looking at. To improve upon this technique, we propose to make our procedure more interactive by replacing the video screen with a humanoid robot. We have been successful in building robots that detect human social cues and respond to people in a contingent, social fashion. These robots evoke social responses in children (making it possible to measure a child's ability to attribute human qualities); they can express social cues with great control, one at a time (making it possible to measure a child's reactions to specific social cues); and they are interactive (making it possible to measure the child's visual engagement with an object that behaves like a human being). The attempt to merge eye-tracking techniques and humanoid robotics represents an effort to utilize the best technologies available in social development research and artificial intelligence to create an early detection procedure capable of identifying the largest number of children at risk for autism.  Fluorescent Probes for the Detection and Evaluation of Occult Ovarian Cancer Team Leader: Key Investigators: Team Disciplines: Abstract: In the last several years, investigators have shown that classical imaging can be greatly enhanced by the use of reagents, which react with occult tumor and show the presence of very small tumors by signaling molecular events which are characteristic of cancer. Essentially these molecular reagents, or molecular probes, can be made to detect several mechanisms as \"markers\" of cancer proliferation, such as the growth of abnormal blood vessels, the ability to subvert standard processes of cell death (apoptosis), the over-expression of growth factors and the breakdown of normal communication, or signal transduction, between elements of cell regulation. In this work, we create a broad imaging platform by adding an infra-red channel, which is overlayed and co-registered with the standard visible optical image. By injecting a small amount of indocyanine green (ICG), we see the notable retention of this common ophthalmic marker in abnormal tissue due to the micro-vessel density in tumor. Many similar bio-markers have been shown to specifically infer the molecular signatures of disease. ICG is made to fluoresce by near-infrared peak excitation at ~805nm using either a broadband or laser diode source. The characteristic emission at ~835_nm is captured in a secondary, devoted infra-red camera and combined and co-registered with the standard visible signal.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": null, "_award_schema_version": "0.1.0"}

Abstract Enhancement of anti-HIV Immunity Although the institution of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced morbidity and mortality from HIV-1 infection, the virus persists in tissue reservoirs and rebound viremia occurs when treatment is halted. Recent findings that intermittent compliance with drug therapy stimulates T cell responses have led to the concept that antigenic stimulation through re-exposure to virus, or the boosting of T cell responses via immunization, will be necessary as an adjunct to HAART. We have shown that a highly effective way to generate human anti-viral T cell responses in vivo is by presenting antigens on dendritic cells (DCs) a system of antigen presenting cells (APCs) that stimulate innate and acquired immune responses. This proposal will apply this new modality of enhancing immunity to HIV-1 infection. The specific aims are to: These studies will provide a basis for designing vaccines which target DCs in situ. In addition, they will support the creation of a vaccine research program at Rockefeller University to train clinical investigators in a new area of immune based therapies.  Brian J. Druker, M.D. Biography Brian J. Druker, M.D., is the Director of the OHSU Cancer Institute Leukemia Center. As a Professor of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, he has joint appointments in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Upon graduating from UC San Diego medical school in 1981, Dr. Druker completed his internship and residency in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital: Washington School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. He then trained in Oncology at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Upon completion of his clinical training, Dr. Druker returned to the lab to begin a research career studying the regulation of the growth of cancer cells and how this knowledge could be applied to cancer therapies. His work has been instrumental in the development of a drug that has shown remarkable success in the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. The clinical trials with STI571, commonly known as Gleevec, have been heralded as a new paradigm in cancer therapy. His role in the development of STI571 and application in the clinic have resulted in numerous awards for Dr. Druker, including the AACR Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Award, the John J. Kenney Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the Warren Alpert Prize from Harvard Medical School, and The American Society of Hematology's Dameshek Prize. Abstract Molecularly Targeted Therapies for Leukemia Molecular studies have identified a number of distinct signal transduction pathways that are deregulated in human cancers. A major priority for the cancer research community is the translation of this growing body of knowledge into therapeutics targeted specifically to these pathways. Our work with STI571, an inhibitor of the molecular pathogenetic tyrosine kinases in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have validated this approach. In performing these clinical trials, we have gained a significant amount of experience in the design and implementation of studies with molecularly targeted agents. These studies have confirmed our opinion that an essential part of these studies are molecular endpoints for determination of optimal therapeutic benefit and that a new paradigm needs to be established in which basic science investigations are an integral part of clinical trials of these agents. Having established this paradigm with STI571, we now are turning our attention to the FLT3 tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively activated by mutation in over 30% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), making this the most common mutation in AML. Our goals are to identify a suitable FLT3 inhibitor for clinical trials, to prepare all of the reagents necessary for mutation detection and determination of the activation state of FLT3, and perform clinical trials with a FLT3 inhibitor. We believe that our experience with STI571 makes our group uniquely suited to this task.  Steven A.N. Goldstein, M.A., Ph.D., M.D. Biography Steve A. N.

Abstract Cardiac Ion Channel Mutations in Sudden Childhood Death Over the past 6 years, as genes for ion channels have been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying normal cardiac function and sudden life-threatening diseases of the heart have become increasingly clear. Ion channels control the electrical activity of muscles and nerves. Dysfunction of ion channels leads to dangerous cardiac rhythms and may produce Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). In some children, inherited mutations in ion channels cause disease directly; in others, gene variations lead to an unstable situation, a genetic predisposition, where a secondary challenge such as drug therapy incites a disorder. This proposal seeks to understand, diagnosis and prevent (a) inherited pediatric arrhythmia; (b) drug-induced pediatric arrhythmia; and, (c) SIDS, through pursuit of four Specific Aims: This proposal is feasible because our team cares for the majority of children in Connecticut with abnormal ECG findings, syncope/near syncope, palpitations, aborted sudden cardiac demise, seizures and many treated with arrhythmia-associated medications; moreover, all cases of SIDS in the State are now referred to the Goldstein laboratory for genetic study, and a collaboration with the NIH Pediatric Pharmacology Research Network (NICH-PPRU) is being designed. The proposal is timely and practical because the tools we need to proceed are now available. Thus, we have recently used these approaches to link both rare mutations and common polymorphisms in ion channel genes to inherited LQTS, drug-induced arrhythmia and periodic paralysis in adults and, thereby, elucidated some of the changes in ion channel physiology that lead to disease. Potential benefits of the proposal include the knowledge to avoid drug-induced arrhythmia (through pre-prescription genotyping), genotype-based risk assessment for sudden childhood deaths, interventions based on pathophysiology, and development of genetic tests for inherited and acquired pediatric arrhythmia (a real need as children are often quite difficult to diagnose). Through proven approaches and forays in new directions we seek to improve child health and train a remarkable group of students, fellows and junior faculty in bench-to-bedside research.  Dianna M. Milewicz, M.D., Ph.D. Biography Dianna M. Milewicz, M.D. Ph.D., is Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at The University of Texas Medical School at Houston. She is Director of the M.D./Ph.D. Program and co-Director of the Biomedical Engineering Center, both of which are joint programs between The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Her research interests include the genetic basis of cardiovascular diseases, and understanding the effect of identified mutations on protein function. She has recently established a genetic core laboratory to provide molecular biology and genetic expertise to clinicians who want to initiate genetic studies on their patient populations. Abstract Genetic Basis of Aortic Aneurysms and Dissections The major disease processes affecting the aorta are aortic aneurysms and dissections. Aortic aneurysms are a major health problem in the United States, representing the 13th major cause of death, accounting for nearly 15,000 deaths annually. Ten to twenty percent of all aneurysms result from a genetic predisposition for the disorder. Although some familial aneurysms are due to inherited defects in extracellular matrix proteins, including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, the majority of inherited aneurysms occur as an isolated cardiovascular abnormality, segregating in families as a monogenic autosomal dominant disorder. We have identified 25 families with autosomal dominant inheritance of thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections, in whom the disease is characterized by variable expression and decreased penetrance. Using DNA obtained from family members and polymorphic markers spaced throughout the human genome, we have mapped a defective gene causing the disorder in 12 of these families to 5 Mb region at 5q13-14. Dr. Craig Basson and his colleagues (Cornell University Medical College) have mapped a second locus for familial aneurysms in one large family to 11q23. We have confirmed further genetic heterogeneity for this disorder by the identification of families in whom the inheritance of the phenotype is not linked to the two identified loci. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to identify the mutant genes that predispose an individual to thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections. The specific aims are the following: The proposed studies will identify the defective gene at a major locus for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. Identification of the genetic etiology of aortic aneurysms and dissections will enable preclinical diagnosis in families at risk. In addition, identification of the defective genes will lead to the development of experiment models of vascular pathology to increase understanding of the molecular pathology and provide the basis for rationale intervention.  Charles L. Sawyers, M.D. Biography Dr. Sawyers is Professor of Medicine and Director of the Prostate Cancer Program Area at the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer. He is a member of the UCLA Molecular Biology Institute and a practicing oncologist in the UCLA prostate cancer clinic. Dr. Sawyers is well-known in leukemia circles for his work on the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia. He was a primary participant in the design and conduct of clinical trials of the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 (Gleevec), and his lab was the first to identify mechanisms of drug resistance due to Bcr-Abl gene mutation and amplification. He has also applied his expertise in signal transduction to human prostate cancer. His group has developed a novel set of human prostate cancer xenografts which have allowed molecular biological investigations into the mechanisms of hormone-refractory prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Most recently his laboratory has implicated deregulation of the PTEN/AKT pathway as a major event in advanced prostate cancer. Abstract Kinase Inhibitor Therapy for Cancers with Aberrant PTEN/Akt Pathway Signaling My research has focused on characterizing signal transduction pathway abnormalities in human cancers—first in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and now in prostate cancer. In addition, I have first hand experience in clinical research, through the design and conduct of the phase I-II trials of STI-571 in CML in collaboration with Brian Druker. Most recently, I have linked these two aspects of my career by showing that resistance to STI-571 can occur through Bcr-Abl gene amplification or mutation. In addition, to teaching us about CML and kinase inhibitor therapy, this work clearly demonstrates the value of molecular target analysis in patients treated with signal transduction inhibitors. Several years ago, my lab demonstrated that the PTEN/Akt pathway is dysregulated in up to 50 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. We and others have demonstrated that aberrant signaling through this pathway is sufficient to cause prostate cancer (and other cancers) in mouse models. Now we have pre-clinical evidence that an inhibitor of the mTOR kinase, which is a downstream component of the PTEN/Akt pathway, is effective treatment for prostate cancers and gioblastomas with PTEN/Akt pathway abnormalities. One mTOR inhibitor (CCI-779) has completed phase I safety testing and is well tolerated at doses above that required to inhibit mTOR. My goal for the Doris Duke award is to apply the STI-571/CML model for developing kinase inhibitor therapy to cancers in which the PTEN/Akt pathway signaling is dysregulated. We will develop the appropriate molecular assays to identify cancers with perturbations in the PTEN/Akt pathway and conduct clinical trials of CCI-779 in these patients.  Margaret A. Shipp, M.D. Biography Margaret A. Shipp, M.D. is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Director of the Lymphoma Program at both the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the newly expanded Dana-Farber/Harvard Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. Shipp obtained her medical degree from Washington University School of Medicine and completed her residency in Internal Medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Thereafter, she completed a fellowship in Medical Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and subsequently joined the faculty. Dr. Shipp's clinical and laboratory research focuses on the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of the most common lymphoid malignancy, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Dr. Shipp coordinated the development of the International Prognostic Index which is used worldwide to individualize treatment approaches to DLBCL and other aggressive lymphomas. More recently, she has led efforts to identify and evaluate rational treatment targets in DLBCL. Dr. Shipp is the recipient of numerous awards including an American Cancer Society Junior Faculty Award, a Leukemia Society of America Scholar Award, membership in the American Society of Clinical Investigation and designation as a Stohlman Scholar of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of America. Abstract Rational Risk-Related Treatment Strategies in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, is currently curable in only 40% of patients. Clinical prognostic factor models such as the International Prognostic Index identify patients who are unlikely to be cured with standard therapy. However, these clinical models do not provide additional insights regarding more effective treatment strategies. In the absence of molecular insights into the observed heterogeneity of DLBCL, therapeutic approaches to \"high-risk\" patients have largely focused on modifying doses and schedules of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and adding stem cell support. However, these approaches have not significantly improved DLBCL patient survival, underscoring the need to identify more rational, molecularly defined approaches to treatment. The clinical features used to identify \"high-risk\" DLBCL are likely to be surrogate variables for intrinsic molecular heterogeneity in the disease. For this reason, we have used a variety of approaches to define the molecular bases for outcome differences, characterize biologically discrete subsets of DLBCL and identify rational treatment strategies in the disease. Most recently, we have successfully utilized gene expression profiling and supervised learning methods to predict outcome and identify novel treatment targets in a pilot series of patients with DLBCL. We propose to build upon our previous studies to: Define molecular signatures of cured versus fatal disease;  Robert F. Siliciano, M.D., Ph.D. Biography Dr. Robert F. Siliciano is Professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He received his BA from Princeton in 1974 and then completed an MD and a PhD in Immunology at Johns Hopkins. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School with Ellis Reinherz, he returned to Johns Hopkins. His research has focused on AIDS vaccine development and mechanisms of HIV persistence in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy. His group has identified a latent reservoir for HIV in resting memory CD4+ T cells that allows the virus to persist indefinitely despite strong antiviral immune responses and potent antiretroviral therapy. The discovery of this reservoir has led to a major change in strategies for the treatment of HIV infection, with a shift towards a more conservative approach to the initiation of therapy now that eradication of the infection with antiretroviral drugs no longer a realistic goal. His group is currently working on strategies for optimizing the treatment of HIV infection. Dr. Siliciano is the recipient of an NIH Merit Award and has served as chair of the NIH Study Section on AIDS and Related Research. At Johns Hopkins, he directs the MD-PhD program.

Alan D. D'Andrea, M.D. Alan D. D'Andrea, M.D., is a Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and the Ted Williams Senior Investigator at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Dr. D'Andrea obtained his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1983 and completed a Pediatric Residency training at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 1986. He performed his post-doctoral research training at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, MA. At that time he and his collaborators cloned the gene for the Erythropoietin Receptor, a major regulator of normal human blood cell formation. After completing his research training, Dr. D'Andrea joined the Harvard Medical School Faculty in 1990. Dr. D'Andrea is internationally known for his research in the fields of human blood cell formation and cancer susceptibility. He directs a laboratory at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and is the Co-Director of the Clinical Gene Therapy Center at Children's Hospital, Boston. Dr. D'Andrea is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Lucille P. Markey Scholar Award (1990), the American Academy of Pediatrics Award for Excellence in Research (1997), and the Stohlman Scholar Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (2000). Dr. D'Andrea's basic research on Fanconi Anemia and his contributions in the field of gene therapy were recently featured on CBS Sunday Morning. Establishment of a Diagnostic & Treatment Center for Fanconi Anemia Dr. D'Andrea's research focuses on Fanconi Anemia (FA), a hereditary anemia and cancer susceptibility disorder. Children born with FA have birth defects and often develop bone marrow failure (anemia) by their fifth birthday. Many of these children go on to develop leukemia or other cancers. The treatment of choice for FA patients is a bone marrow transplant from a histocompatible sibling donor. Dr. D'Andrea's laboratory focuses on the molecular basis of this disease. His laboratory has determined that three of the FA gene products (proteins) normally associate to activate a fourth FA protein. The function of this fourth FA protein is to accumulate in regions of DNA damage on chromosomes, presumably to aid repair, thereby preventing further genetic mutations and the progression to cancer. Understanding the molecular basis of this disease is likley to lead to a more rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of FA patients. While FA is a rare disease, acquired mutations in the FA genes may also contribute to the formation of bone marrow failure and cancers in the general (non-FA) patient population. In the course of his research, Dr. D'Andrea has established a Comprehensive Fanconi Anemia Center at Harvard Medical School which is the focus of his Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award. This Center offers a wide range of services to patients and families with Fanconi Anemia.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": null, "_award_schema_version": "0.1.0"}

Rader, M.D.,  Charis Eng, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.P., Biography Dr. Charis Eng is the Chair and founding Director of the Genomic Medicine Institute of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, founding Director and attending clinical cancer geneticist of the institute's clinical component, the Center for Personalized Genetic Healthcare, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Genetics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. She holds a joint appointment as Professor of Molecular Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and is a full member of Cleveland Clinic's Taussig Cancer Center and a member of the CASE Comprehensive Cancer Center. She was recently honored by the designation National Scholar of the Davis Heart and Lung Research Institute of The Ohio State University, and continues to hold an honorary appointment at the University of Cambridge. Dr. Eng's research interests may be broadly characterized as clinical cancer genetics translational research. Her work on RET testing in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and the characterization of the widening clinical spectra of PTEN gene mutations have been acknowledged as the paradigm for the practice of clinical cancer genetics. Abstract Genetics of PTEN and Molecular-Based Patient Care Tumor suppressors act like automobile brakes to prevent cell overgrowth. Our project utilizes a single model tumor suppressor gene called PTEN as a model for translating laboratory discoveries to evidence-based patient care. Germline gene mutations represent faults or alterations in DNA, which is the stuff of genes. Germline mutations of PTEN cause Cowden syndrome (CS). CS which was believed to be rare, is actually under-recognized particularly by non-cancer genetics professionals and therefore, diagnoses are not made. This is rather dangerous because CS is a hereditary condition characterized by breast and thyroid cancers and perhaps cancer of the uterus. Because PTEN-associated CS is so difficult to recognize the first objective of our study is to statistically and genetically model the clinical features of over 1000 patients with features reminiscent of CS so that the fewest and most parsimonious features may be objectively identified. Identifying these features will help primary caregivers identify such individuals for purposes of referral to cancer genetics professionals. It is not known if women with only breast cancer and no obvious features of CS might have unsuspected germline PTEN mutations. Therefore, the second objective of our study is to examine a large population-based series of women diagnosed with breast cancer to see what proportion of such women have germline PTEN mutations. Having germline PTEN mutations would not only put them at increased risk of other cancers, but also has implications for their families. Somatic gene mutations are present only in cancer cells and cannot be inherited. Because somatic mutations of PTEN have been described in sporadic (not familial, not genetic) breast tumors, our third objective is to seek out and characterize non-traditional, non-genetic alterations of PTEN as new targets of therapy and prevention.  James L.M. Ferrara, M.D., Biography Dr. Ferrara is a Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Michigan Medical School and the Director of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. He received his BA from Xavier University and an MA from Oxford University before obtaining his medical degree in 1980 from Georgetown Medical School. He was an intern and resident in Pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Boston and completed his Pediatric Hematology/Oncology training at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute before joining the faculty of Harvard Medical School where he remained until 1998. Dr. Ferrara is one of the world's leading authorities on the immunologic complications of bone marrow transplantation and his research interests focus on making transplantation safer and more available to a wider group of patients. He currently serves on the National Board of Directors of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and has received numerous honors for his contributions to this field including the Stohlman Scholar Award from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Award from the German government. Abstract Novel Strategies to Improve Allogenic BMT Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an important curative therapy for a number of hematologic malignancies, but it is complicated by Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). Research in Dr. Ferrara's laboratory has demonstrated agents that protect the GI tract provide new opportunities for prevention of the cascade of inflammatory cytokines that can reduce these complications. This project will support several clinical trials designed to test novel agents that can reduce the toxic complications of BMT. Funding from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation will facilitate the laboratory evaluation of patient samples from all of these trials, support the design of new trials of these agents and enhance the mentoring of junior faculty members involved in translational BMT studies. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a protein that stimulates the grown of epithelial cells including those of the GI tract. Recombinant human KGF (rHuKGF) protects the GI tract, prevents severe GVHD and preserves donor T cell function needed for the beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect. Specific aim 1 is to perform a single arm, dose-esclation, safety trial of rHuKGF plus standard GVHD prophylaxis. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha is a major inflammatory cytokine effector of these two disorders. Neutralization of TNF-alpha with soluble dimeric TNF-alpha binding protein (etanercept) can prevent both GVHD and acute lung injury in preclinical studies. Specific Aim 2 is to perform a single arm Phase I-II trial of etanercept plus standard treatment (steroids) to treat newly diagnosed GVHD. Specific Aim 3 is to perform a single-arm, open label Phase I-II study of etanercept plus standard treatment (steroids) to IPS after BMT.  D. Gary Gilliland, Ph.D., M.D., Biography Dr. Gary Gilliland received his PhD in Microbiology from UCLA and his MD at UCSF. He completed Medical Residency and Hematology/Oncology Fellowship training at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and was Chief Medical Resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He is currently Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS), and is on the faculty of the Biomedical and Biological Sciences Program in the Department of Genetics at HMS. He is also an Associate Investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and is the Director of the Leukemia Program at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. His research efforts have focused on genetics and treatment of hematologic malignancies. Abstract Clinical Translational Approaches to Therapy of Myeloid Blood Diseases This is a highly integrated and synergistic proposal that covers the entire spectrum of clinical translational research in myeloid blood diseases. These include the myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most adults and children who develop MPD, MDS or AML eventually succumb to complications related to their disease or therapy. Unfortunately, our therapeutic approaches to these diseases have changed little over the past two decades. There is thus a compelling need to develop more effective and less toxic therapies for these potentially fatal blood disorders. We have devoted a substantial effort to understanding the genetic basis of these MPD, MDS and AML, with the hope that these insights will allow us to develop therapies that target the specific genetic defect that causes the disease. Molecular targeting may allow for more specific and less toxic therapies, and may improve outcome either alone, or in conjunction with more conventional therapies. To this end, this proposal utilizes a comprehensive clinical translational approach to these blood disorders, including (i) cloning of disease alleles, (ii) characterization of the transforming properties in cell culture systems, (iii) development and testing of specific inhibitors in the model systems for transformation, (iv) translation of inhibitors into clinical trials. We have already demonstrated proof-of-principle for this approach in the application of FLT3 inhibitors in therapy of advanced MDS and AML. An attribute of this application is the seamless dovetailing of laboratory and clinical investigation - this is not a unidirectional approach from bench to bedside, but rather a highly interactive and interdependent team of young investigators that derive synergy from the crosstalk between the laboratory and the clinic. However, perhaps the most important strength of the proposal is the dedicated and devoted focus on the career development of the physician-scientists. I have a strong track record of nurturing and supporting the career development of female and male physician-scientists. With the resources of the DCSA, which are entirely devoted to the salary and laboratory support of an exceptionally talent group of medical students, medical residents, hematology/oncology fellows, and junior faculty, I hope to help build the next generation of physician-scientists who will realize our collective dream and fervent hope of developing cures for these devastating blood disorders.  Daniel A. Haber, M.D., Ph.D., Biography Dr. Daniel Haber was born in Paris, France in 1957. He came to the US in 1973 to attend college at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received BS and MS degrees. He continued his studies at Stanford University under the Medical Scientist Training Program. He obtained his PhD in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Schimke in 1981, studying gene amplification as a mechanism of chemotherapeutic drug resistance, and received his MD in 1983. He subsequently completed a medical internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, followed by a clinical fellowship in medical oncology at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (1986). Dr. Haber then pursued postdoctoral research training with Dr. David Housman at MIT, working on the characterization of the Wilms Tumor suppressor gene WT1. He was appointed Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in 1991, and established his laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center to study the genetics of Wilms tumor and breast cancer. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1996 and Professor in 2001. In addition, Dr. Haber serves as Associate Chief for Research in the Hematology Oncology Unit at MGH, as Chair of the Cancer Genetics Program for the Dana Farber-Harvard Comprehensive Cancer Center, and as Director of the MGH Center for Cancer Risk Analysis. He is on the Editorial Board of Cell and Cancer Cell, and serves as Genetics Editor for the New England Journal of Medicine. He has received numerous awards, including the McDonnell Cancer Scholar Award (1990), the American Association for Cancer Research and National Foundation for Cancer Research Professorship in Basic Cancer Research (2000), and a MERIT Award from the National Cancer Institute (2002). He was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation in 1995. He is the author of 122 publications dealing with various aspects of the genetics of pediatric kidney cancer and adult breast cancer. The Doris Duke Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award was awarded for his work on the characterization of CHK2, a cell cycle checkpoint kinase that is mutated in the germline of women with predisposition to breast cancer. Abstract CHK2: A Common Low Penetrance Familial Breast Cancer Gene Germline mutations in BRCA1 account for ~50% of high risk familial breast cancer, while mutations in BRCA2 are responsible for ~25% of cases. These findings have provided important insight into the pathogenesis of breast cancer, and they have made it possible to offer genetic counseling to family members at risk, with consideration of preventive surgery, hormonal chemoprophylaxis, intensive screening regimens, and eventually the possibility of genotype-directed therapy. The etiology of familial breast cancer cases lacking mutations in the BRCA genes is uncertain, and the absence of clear genetic linkage to a third locus has led to the suggestion that these cases may result from a number of lower penetrance genes, which in aggregate, may contribute to both breast cancer kindreds, as well as individuals with less dramatic family histories. A major step in this direction has been the observation that 1% of the population carries a specific truncating mutation in CHK2 (1100delC), while this mutation is present in 5% of familial breast cancer cases (ie. a common low penetrant mutation). CHK2 encodes a kinase, which itself is activated by the DNA damage responsive kinase ATM, and which is capable of phosphorylating p53, CDC25 and BRCA1. As such, CHK2 is positioned at the intersection between DNA damage response sensors and the effectors of cellular checkpoints implicated in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage repair. Our laboratory was the first to identify mutations in CHK2, including 100delC which we discovered in a family with the multicancer phenotype Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, but which lacked the characteristic mutation in p53. CHK2 has now been shown to phosphorylate p53 at the critical 20Serine residue required for its activation following DNA damage. The recent discovery that the specific CHK2 mutation 1100delC is common in the population and confers a moderate risk for breast cancer has raised the possibility that additional mutations in this gene and in other related genes may play a significant role in human breast cancer. In this proposal, we propose 1. to undertake mutational analyses of CHK2 and related genes in familial breast cancer cases lacking mutations in BRCA genes; 2. to define the penetrance (ie. breast cancer risk) and clinical phenotype associated with these mutations; 3. to develop functional assays that allow interpretation of CHK2 missense mutations present in familial breast cancer cases; and 4. to use CHK2 as a model with which to explore how analysis of low penetrance mutations should be integrated into clinical practice. These questions will have significant impact, both in terms of high risk breast cancer care, as well as the more general integration of increasingly complex genetic information into the clinic.  Daniel J. Rader, M.D., Biography Dr. Daniel J. Rader is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Pathology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is Director of Preventive Cardiology and the Lipid Clinic and Associate Director of the General Clinical Research Center. Dr. Rader runs a basic research laboratory focused on genetic regulation of lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis and directs a clinical research program focused on human genetics of lipid disorders and atherosclerosis, imaging of atherosclerosis, and novel approaches to treatment of dyslipidemia and regression of atherosclerosis. He has a particular interest in HDL metabolism, factors and genes involved in its regulation, the nature of the relationship of HDL metabolism to atherosclerosis, and novel approaches to raising HDL cholesterol levels as a tool for treating and preventing atherosclerosis. Dr. Rader is a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation and serves on the executive committee of the Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology Council of the American Heart Association and the scientific board of the Sarnoff Foundation. He is an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association and a recipient of the Burroughs Wellcome Trust Clinician-Scientist Award in Translational Research. Dr. Rader is on the editorial boards of Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology, American Journal of Physiology (Endocrinology and Metabolism), Circulation, Circulation Research, and Trends in Molecular Medicine and is a reviewer for many journals, including Nature, Nature Medicine, Science, New England Journal of Medicine, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. Dr. Rader has authored over 120 peer-reviewed publications as well as many reviews and book chapters. He has written the chapters on lipid disorders and management for several textbooks including Kelley's Textbook of Internal Medicine, Topol's Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, and Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics. He is a frequently invited speaker nationally and internationally on his basic and clinical research in lipoprotein metabolism, atherosclerosis, genetics, and gene therapy and on clinical topics such as novel approaches to cardiovascular risk assessment and management of lipid disorders. Abstract Genetics of Lipid Metabolism and Atherosclerosis Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains epidemic in the U.S. and most of the world. Effective prevention requires accurate identification of those at risk and institution of therapies that reduce risk. Stabilization and regression of atherosclerosis require development of new therapeutic interventions that are effective and complement existing therapies. A better understanding of the genetics of atherosclerosis and its risk factors will provide greater ability to predict future risk as well as lead to new targets for therapeutic intervention. Plasma lipoprotein metabolism is intimately related to the development of atherosclerosis. Plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is directly associated and plasma high-density (HDL) cholesterol inversely associated with ASCVD. Reduction of LDL-C is proven to reduce risk although only by about one-third over 5 years. The effects of raising HDL-C are uncertain as highly effective HDL-raising interventions are not yet available. Our broad goal is to investigate the role of genetic variation in determining levels of LDL-C and HDL-C and translate those findings into new abilities to predict, prevent, and regress atherosclerosis.
