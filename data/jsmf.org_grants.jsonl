In the United States an estimated 13,300 people will die from primary nervous system tumors, and 17,200 will be newly diagnosed. The current pathological classification of brain tumors relies on a few microscopically visible changes within the tumors. These classifications are inadequate for predicting the actual response of a given tumor to therapy. Abnormal growth and differentiation is a hallmark of cancer, and it is very likely that cancer cells express a different repertoire of genes as compared to their normal' counterparts. It is also likely that individual tumor characteristics, such as one tumor's sensitivity to radiation and another's resistance are also reflected in the discrete sets of genes that are expressed. Recently, an approach that allows the measurement of gene expression at thousands of genes simultaneously has been described. This process, established in our lab, prints thousands of different DNAs onto glass slides about one inch by two inches. RNA extracted from the tumor is fluorescently labeled and probed onto the array. The amount of fluorescence at each DNA spot correlates with the abundance of specific mRNA transcript in the tissue. Our aim is to use available resources including a set of 33,506 genes to create a near comprehensive array of genes which are expressed in human gliomas in order to analyze gene expression alterations in human gliomas and in patient-derived laboratory cell lines. This array will create a general resource of use to the community of scientists unraveling the genetics of gliomas. With these arrays, it may be possible to classify cancers by genetic changes rather than being based primarily on cellular morphology and idiosyncratic stains. Such genetics classifications should be more predictive of outcome and provide a better tool for determining which tumors require more aggressive therapy. Finally, defining genes that are involved in the genesis of human cancers may provide important strategic insight into the development of novel therapeutic agents.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': \"University of California - Los Angeles Children's Hospital\", 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '1998', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Thus, innovative approaches to the treatment of these diseases are desperately needed. We and others have demonstrated in pre-clinical models that a number of immune based therapies are effective against brain tumours. We have shown that vaccine strategies using gene modified cells such as cytokine-producing tumour cells, allogeneic gene modified cells or antigen loaded dendritic cells are potent stimulators of immunity against tumours within the CNS in animal (1-3). As well, in another model of immunotherapy we have shown that direct delivery of cytotoxic cytokines, such as TNF a, to the site of CNS tumours can reduce or eliminate tumour growth in mice (2,4). In all of these models the induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis) through biological pathways is pivotal to efficacy. Thus, it follows that if mechanism exist that render glial tumours resistant to physiological mediators of apoptosis the likelihood of successful immunotherapy is reduced. Such findings would have important implications for the future development of treatment strategies employing immunotherapies. i) that the regulation of apoptosis in malignant glioma mediated by the physiological pathways involving factors such as Fas and TNF a are intimately linked to the pathogenesis and behaviour of these diseases. ii) that a link in the effector pathways exists between the mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) expression in approximately 50% of glioblastoma, and the relative resistance observed to Fas and TNF cc related apoptotic events in these tumours. iii) that any relative resistance to the biological mediators of apoptosis conferred by the expression of the EGFRvIII will in turn lead to a resistance to biological therapies such as active immunotherapy in the form of vaccines or the direct delivery of cytotoxic cytokines. The overall objectives of this project are to examine the relationship between the physiological pathways controlling programmed cell death and the expression of the EGFRvIII on malignant glioma using a unique species specific syngeneic murine model. Specifically, these studies will explore the significance of interactions between these pathways upon tumourigenesis and resistance to the biological mediators of apoptosis such as TNF a, Fas and perforin/granzyme. This project also aims to investigate whether EGFRvIII expression mediates inhibition of effective immunotherapies which rely upon the induction of apoptosis via biological pathways. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that the use of agents which specifically inhibit the function of EGFRvIIl will down regulate kinase activity of this receptor and enhance the rate of apoptosis in response to biological therapies.

In about 40% to 50% of high grade gliomas, tumor robustness is correlated with the overexpression of the truncated form of the EGFR (EGFRD), which possesses persistent kinase activity (Ekstrand et al.,1992; Liberman et al., 1985, Malden et aL, 1988, Schlegel et al., 1994). EGFR overexpression correlates with shorter survival and faster recurrence. Indeed human glioma cells,U87MG which express the truncated persistently active receptor (U87MG. EGFRD)induce enhanced tumorigenicity in nude mice (Nishikawa et al., 1994). The enhanced tumorigenicity is correlated with high expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCl-XL. Overexpression of Bcl-XL has been shown to be associated with drug resistance (Ibrado et a., 1996, Minn et al., 1995) which is also a hallmark of glioma cells which express EGFRD (Nagane et al., 1996; Nagane et aL, 1998). Nagane et al reported that EGFRD expression in glioma cells confers resistance to cis-platin(CDDP). This drug resistance is attributed to EGFRA signaling since it does not occur in \"isogenic\" cells expressing the wild type receptor or a kinase dead EGFRD. It seems therefore that in this malignant form of glioma the truncated receptor not only drives the tumor to grow fast but also confers to the tumor anti-apoptotic signals. Blocking the EGFR kinase by selective inhibitors such as AG 1478 and AG 1517 induces a reduction of Bcl-XL expression and sensitizes the cells to CDDP (cis-platin). It is likely that in other forms of brain tumors anti-apoptotic signals are also enhanced but this feature has so far not been described. Similar synergistic effects of tyrphostins with cytotoxic drugs were obtained in HER-2 overexpressing cells from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCL), where a selective inhibitor of HER-2 resensitizes the cells to cytotoxic drugs (Tsai et al., 1996). It has been pointed out that enhanced activity of HER family receptors leads to the persistent activation of Src family kinases, especially pp60c-Src (Levitzki, 1996 for review). In a recent study we have demonstrated that Src family kinases, especially pp60c-Src is constitutively active in tumor cells which overexpress EGFR and its ligands (Osherov and Levitzki,1994), and the HER-2 kinase (Levitzki 1996).We have recently extended this observation to HPV 16 immortalized keratinocytes which overexpress the EGFR and its ligands (Ben-Bassat et al.,in preparation). Our preliminary results (see below) show that expression of Src antisense RNA or the application of Src selective kinase inhibitors to cells which overexpress EGFR or HER-2 kinase, result in the reduction of Bcl-XL expression, inhibition of cell growth and the inhibition of colony formation in soft agar. Another branch of anti-apoptotic signaling pathway is regulated by PKB which is downstream to PI-3 kinase (Kennedy et al., 1997; Alessi and Cohen, 1998). For example, a recent study suggests that PKB/c-Akt phosphorylation of BAD, a pro-aopototic family member of the Bcl-2/Bcl-X family of proteins, couples survival signals to the death machinery (Datta et al., 1997). This study provides a link between the PKB/c-Akt pathway and the Bcl/Bcl-X family of proteins. During the grant period we propose to explore the roles of Src kinase and of the PKB pathway in the robustness of glioma and examine their role, if any, in conferring to the ghoma cells their robustness and drug resistance.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The Hebrew University of Jerusalem', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '1998', 'amount': '398,700', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Furthermore, life expectancy has not significantly improved in the last decade in spite of refinements in diagnosis, surgery, and adjuvant therapy. What has been achieved is an increased understanding of the molecular events that underlie these tumors, and the hope is that this will lead to the new therapies that are urgently needed. One route to new treatments is via the identification of genes that satisfy three criteria: [I] expression of the gene is restricted to the tumor; [2] gene products drive the proliferation, survival and/or invasion of tumor cells; [3] gene products can be inhibited by pharmacologically suitable molecules. The SETA (SH3 domain encoding, !expressed in tumorigenic astrocytes; SH3 is src homology region 3) gene, which is the focus of this research proposal, has the potential of satisfying all three criteria. As described in Preliminary Data (see page 7) expression studies at the mRNA level show that SETA is found in experimentally induced rat gliomas, and human tumors, but not in the normal adult brain. Furthermore, the rodent SETA protein is expressed in cultured astrocytes when they acquire the ability to form tumors. These data suggest that SETA expression correlates with tumor formation, and so satisfies the first criterion. To determine the role of the SETA protein in glioma biology the following specific aims are proposed: 1. i. Cloning of the human SETA gene. ii. Generation of antibodies against the human SETA protein. iii. Analyzing human brain tumor sections with anti-SETA antibodies 2. i. Making of SETA misexpression constructs. ii. Establishing SETA misexpressing cell lines. iii. Characterizing the impact of SETA misexpression on cell phenotype. iv. Studying the posttranslational modification of SETA proteins. 3. i .

Identifying the consensus sequence of peptides that bind SETA SH3 domains by phage display library screening.

Here we wish to establish an in vivo model to study the regulatory mechanisms involved in the expression of the PDGFRA. For this purpose we will create transgenic mice with YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), carrying the complete PDGFRa gene. Manipulation of these YACs by homologous recombination in yeast, and the subsequent introduction of the mutated YACs into mice, will enable us to map the regulatory elements involved in the correct expression of PDGFRA in various tissues. This information will then be used to search for possible regulatory defects associated with brain tumor formation and leading to the improper expression of the PDGFRa. In addition, we will use the isolated elements of the PDGFRA promoter to specifically target putative glioma precursor cells, of which a large fraction is thought to be PDGFRa positive. This will be done in \"classical\" transgenic mouse models, where the role of different growth and survival factors (particularly PDGF) in the development of brain tumors is our focus.

The dual role of Ang-2 will be determined using our VEGF overexpression system and a regulated VEGF receptor antagonist (truncated Flt-1) expression system to modulate the expression levels of VEGF in vivo.

Consider a model of the spread of an infectious disease among the world's populations. The model specifies such factors as the lifestyles and behaviors of different populations, their geographic locations of the populations, and the modes of interaction between and among populations. Assuming that the model's assumptions are valid, using such models offers many advantages: complete observability of all model variables at all places at all times (how many people in Chicago have the disease 5 days after an infection outbreak), control over the simulation's initial conditions (what if the outbreak began in Seattle instead?), and control over the simulation's parameters (what effect on the spread of the disease would canceling all commercial airline flights have?). Mathematical and computational techniques can be applied to the model to develop a picture of the dynamics of the entire simulated system to determine when bifurcations occur. A bifurcation can be generally described as a set of parameters where a model undergoes a profound change in its dynamics. For example, in the disease model above, let x describe the frequency of interaction between infected and uninfected members of the population. If x is less than a critical value x*, the disease may fade away on its own or be locally contained; but if x is greater than x*, the disease starts spreading at an accelerating rate. In this context, x is a bifurcation parameter and x* is a bifurcation. Such models have their limits, however. They are only as good as the data that is put into them and the assumptions made by the model creator -- we have all experienced the weather forecast that never came true. To make models more accurate, we need to obtain more data and limit our assumptions; to make them better understood, we often need to make the models simpler, which may require us to expand our assumptions. This proposal is concerned with pursuing an alternative approach to understanding complex systems, which we call the hybrid simulation-experiment (HSE). The general idea is to construct a model system that is part experiment and part simulation running in \"real-time'' -- the model performs its calculations at the same pace as the experimental elements are changing in time. This approach has been used in various contexts in widely disparate fields, but has not been considered to be a distinct approach to studying complex systems in its own right. For example, economists have studied the effect of pricing systems on market dynamics -- in some cultures you walk into a store and see a fixed price on the shelf, deciding whether or not to purchase a product. In other cultures negotiating between the buyer and seller is the expected norm. Scientists have studied these modes of buyer/seller interaction using computer simulations interacting with human subjects. The experimental component is the human subjects, who are free to interact with the simulation and make their own choices. The simulation component serves to simulated different pricing systems and control the interaction among subjects. Such a hybrid approaches has many advantages -- by using human subjects many assumptions have been eliminated, with the remaining assumptions confined to the simulation that controls the interactions among users. The simulation component of the HSE approach allows the introduction of controllability and observability (of the simulation components) to an otherwise experimental system. This approach is limited to particular experimental systems. For example, we could not construct a computer simulation that interacted in any significant way with the climate of North America! What is required is an experimental system whose size and speed is compatibility with technologies that allow interaction with the system and computational technologies that allow simulations to run in real-time at a sufficient speed. My particular field of research, computational neuroscience, is concerned with understanding the biophysical basis of electrical activity in neurons and how neurons use these electrical properties to communicate with other neurons and process information. Neurons have a voltage across their cell membrane, which can be considered to be a capacitor with several complex nonlinear resistances (referred to by neuroscientists using the reciprocal conductance) in parallel. The neuron may be at rest, which means the voltage is constant. The neuron can also fire an action potential, in which some of the nonlinear resistances rapidly turn on and off, causing a spike-like voltage waveform several milliseconds long. The neuron may spike only in response to input, or it may oscillate, generating a constant repetition of action potentials. We record this voltage by inserting an electrode into the neuron, and we stimulate the neuron by injecting current into the neuron. Neurons can also stimulate each other through synapses, where an action potential in one neuron causes a conductance to change in another neuron. The general biophysical principals underlying these changed in electrical are well understood, thanks in part to the pioneering work of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Eccles, who shared the Nobel prize in 1963 for their research into the nature of electrical excitability in neurons and interneuronal communication. Starting with these principals, many neuroscientists use computational models to understand the neural systems that they study. Much progress has been made with this approach, but there are limits to what is experimentally testable using conventional techniques. For example, there are many mathematical and computational models of how neurons generate an action potential. In these models, we typically manipulate one of the aforementioned conductances (g), since that is what synapses do. When g is below a critical value g*, the voltage in the cell is constant. When g is increased greater than g*, the cell oscillates and periodically generates action potentials. Thus at g*, a bifurcation from steady-state silence to oscillatory activity occurs. By the late 1980's, years of modeling and the analysis of such models have revealed two common general mathematical mechanisms for this bifurcation -- a saddle-node bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. These bifurcations can be differentiated by such features as the range of frequencies of periodic activity that the cell demonstrates and how the cell response to input when it is electrically silent. But do these two mechanisms exist in nature? This is where the HSE approach is useful. We can record the voltage from a neuron, read it into a computer, solve a simulation that models one or more of the aforementioned nonlinear conductances, and inject a current into the neuron that is equivalent to the current flowing through one of these simulated conductances. We have artificially added a conductance to the cell we are recording from. We have precise control over this simulated conductance, thus we can systematically vary g and study the resulting electrical properties of the hybrid simulation-neuron, creating a detailed bifurcation diagram of the HSE. Thus the HSE approach can be used to modify the electrical activity of a single neuron, artifically adding conductances or modifying existing conductances within the neuron. We can also use the HSE to study methods of interneuronal communication. Artificial networks can be created using neurons which are isolated from each other, using the simulation to create artificial connections between neurons. Thus we can have precise control over the strength and speed (kinetics) of simulated synapses between two real neurons. This approach can be used to study under what conditions neurons synchronize their oscillatory activity what form of synchrony occurs: in-phase, where the neurons are spiking at the same time, or anti-phase, where the neurons alternate spiking in a constant back-and-forth relationship. In the context of this proposal, a final step in this proposal is to attempt to define a science and technology of HSE. How should results be interpreted? The experimental element of the system, the neurons, have a certain intrinsic amount of variability, and there is also measurement error. The simulation portion of the system must be capable of running and responding in real-time, which poses computational challenges. The numerical techniques used to solve the models within the simulation have numerical inaccuracies, and these inaccuracies may be exacerbated by using simpler numerical techniques that make it possible to run the simulation in real-time. Techniques must be developed to quantify the uncertainties, variabilities, and inaccuracies that may be present in the experimental and simulation portions of a HSE. In conclusion, this project attempts to solve some basic question in computational neuroscience, while developing methodologies that may pave the way to other applications of HSEs to studying complex systems. This approach to investigating complex systems poses many challenges but is an exciting idea that is still in its infancy.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Georgia Institute of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002073\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '449,624', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

One cerebellum tumor, medulloblastoma, arises from uncontrolled growth of granule cells. Medulloblastomas develop frequently in people who are born with a genetic disorder (Gorlin's syndrome) in which the sonic hedgehog growth factor becomes overactive. This growth factor can make normal cells divide. Work from insects suggests that sonic hedgehog needs other proteins, such as EXT proteins, in order to work properly. We found that several EXT genes are expressed in developing neurons in the cerebellum. In particular, one EXT is expressed in normal cerebellar cells, and is partially turned off in medulloblastomas. We propose to analyze when and where all these genes are expressed during normal cerebellar development, and whether expression changes in tumors. EXT genes allow cells to make proteoglycan molecules that surround the cells. We have found that when we alter proteoglycans, sonic hedgehog can no longer make granule cells divide.

Experience with our native language actually shapes the way in which we hear speech sounds. Until about 10 months of age, infants show a striking ability to hear differences between speech sounds, surpassing even adults in their ability to hear differences among foreign speech sounds. However, by their first birthday, infants are have become native listeners and, like adults, are able only to discriminate among speech sounds used by their native language. Japanese infants, for example, can discriminate [r] from [l] (as in \"rock\" and \"lock\") throughout their first few months of life despite the fact that [r] and [l] are not distinguished in the Japanese language. However, by the end of their first year Japanese infants, like Japanese adults, no longer discriminate [r] from [l]. They have become native listeners. So far, research has been able to document this milestone of development across a number of languages and speech sounds. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that guide this change. How does experience with a native language change the way that we hear speech? This is a difficult question and it remains unanswered. The rapidity with which infants' perception of speech changes has led many scientists to propose that infants are born with specialized mechanisms shaped by evolution to decode speech sounds. By this view, infants possess specialized brain mechanisms to recognize all of the possible speech sounds of the world's languages. This explains their early ability to hear differences between both foreign and native sounds. Experience with the native language then shapes these mechanisms via a \"use it or lose it\" principal. The regions not used by the native language are inactive and thus are lost, causing infants' decline in the ability to hear differences among foreign sounds. This project is a departure from accounts that suggest infants are born with specialized brain mechanisms. The account favored in these studies relies only on the properties of the auditory system and general mechanisms of learning. To understand how such an approach might account for infants' declining ability to hear the difference between foreign sounds, it is helpful to consider what infants are hearing during their first year. Across the world, there are over 5000 distinct languages. These languages make use of well over 800 different speech sounds (phonemes). Individual languages differ dramatically in the groups of phonemes they use to communicate meaning. English employs about 50 phonemes (phonemes are different from the letters of our alphabet - some letter combinations are spoken in several ways, thus there are more phonemes than letters). Different languages have different patterns. There exist languages that use as few as 11 and as many as 141 phonemes. The phonemes that a language uses shape the pattern of experience developing infants encounter in the first months of life. The hypothesis of the present investigation is that experience with structured patterns of speech sounds present in the language encourages infants to categorize speech. Listeners encounter many different examples of a particular speech sound in any given day. There are subtle, but very important, differences in the way that people pronounce speech. When a woman says \"rock\", for example, the properties of the \"r\" are quite different from when a man or a child pronounces the same sound. Even within a single speaker, different pronunciations have different characteristics. One of the challenges for infants is to discover the commonalities across this variety of sounds in order to recognize all of the variants as examples of \"r\". Adding to the challenge of this task is the fact that infants must manage to categorize speech in a manner that is appropriate for their native language. An English baby must distinguish \"r\" from \"l\", but a Japanese infant must learn to treat these sounds as equivalent. We believe that changes in the way infants hear foreign speech sounds is a result of learning to categorize speech. The present studies investigate whether categorization may emerge from experience with the patterns of speech sounds that vary across languages. So far, tests of these predictions have not been undertaken because it is difficult and even unethical to manipulate infants' experience with speech. However, very new research has suggested an alternative means of testing these questions. Under the right experimental conditions, animal species (e.g., birds, monkeys and rodents) learn speech categories in a manner that is strikingly similar to humans. It is unlikely that these animals possess specialized brain mechanisms for decoding human speech. Thus, this evidence indicates that the mechanisms of speech category acquisition may be very general, extending even to animals. This finding opens the door of opportunity for testing whether the loss of the ability to hear differences in foreign sounds is brought on by categorization. It is possible to very carefully manipulate animals experience with speech. As a result, the present studies have complete control over animal listeners' experience and can test how patterns of experience that model different languages influence perception. The goal is to determine whether animals exhibit changes in their ability to hear differences in speech sounds as a function of the patterns of the \"native-language\" sounds they experience in the experiment. Using this method, we can uncover the mechanisms of learning that are important. Understanding these properties will have important implications. For example, one of the most difficult things about learning a second language as an adult is the simple fact that it is difficult even to hear the differences between foreign speech sounds. Finding out the means by which perception of speech is shaped by experience with a language will provide important clues about how to develop efficient ways to train second language learners. More generally, these data will contribute to our understanding of how experience influences the way we perceive the world.  The following articles address the issue of how infants perceive speech and how experience with a native language influences their perception.

Despite advances in surgical techniques, radiotherapy and chemotherapy the prognosis of patients with gliomas is poor. Thus, further understanding of the molecular processes underlying the tumorigenesis of gliomas is essential for the development of effective treatments. The development of tumors is associated with impaired control of cell proliferation. Protein kinase C, a family of serine-threonine kinases is involved in carcinogenesis. The expression of specific PKC isoforms is increased in different tumors and overexpression of PKC interferes with cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. PKC is also involved in the tumorigenesis of malignant gliomas, but the identity of the isoforms and the mechanisms involved in their effects are not known. In this study we will explore the mechanisms involved in the effects of specific PKC isoforms on cell growth and differentiation and the interaction of PKCCC with the EGF receptor. These studies will provide important information regarding the cross talk between PKC and tyrosine kinases and how dysregulation of specific isoforms leads to impaired cellular function associated with tumor promotion. Most malignant gliomas are resistant to cell death induced by drugs and radiation. Thus, delineating the role of PKC in the regulation of glioma cell death has important implications for the use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these tumors.

However, malignant brain tumours are second only to stroke as a cause of death from neurological disorders and deserve attention because of their remarkable resistance to available treatments. The prognosis for high-grade malignant brain tumours, the commonest type in adults, has remained very poor with typical median survival of only 9-12 months despite optimum management. Although these tumours are most common in older people with a peak age at presentation of 65-75 years they also occur in childhood and in both age groups cause very significant disability, distress and morbidity to patients, families and carers. The primary treatment modalities for these tumours are surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. Truly curative surgery is rarely possible because of diffuse infiltration of tumour cells in to normal brain tissue. Post operative radiotherapy improves survival in high-grade tumours by 5-6 months and may improve disability in up to one third of patients. However, long term disease control is rarely achieved. Chemotherapy (drug) treatments may further improve survival but probably has a minor impact for the majority of patients. Because of the disappointing results of conventional treatments many new approaches have been tried in these patients. Many have focussed on using new methods to increase the dose of radiotherapy that can be given to the tumour, using radio-active sources that can be implanted directly to the tumour site or very accurately targeted beams of radiation from conventional radiotherapy machines. Unfortunately these approaches, while improving tumour control in some instances have commonly led to increased damage to surrounding normal brain and have not yet been shown to improve the outlook for most patients. It is clear then that new approaches to treating these tumours are needed. In order to develop these it is necessary to improve our understanding of how brain tumours respond to treatment, particularly what allows them to survive toxic treatments like radiotherapy that can cure tumours at many other sites. New ways of studying the way that both normal and tumour cells react to radiation may allow us to do this. In particular it is becoming clear that, especially in the brain, the individual cells do not react simply as individuals when they are attacked by toxic agents. The different cell populations interact with each other, even at some distance from the site of the original toxin or injury. This means that simply looking at how individual cells are killed by radiation will not allow us to understand how some cells survive better than we would expect, we need to look at how cells communicate with each other and how they may help each other to survive, or encourage each other to die. This may be important for normal brain cells as well as tumour cells. Until recently it has been difficult to answer this sort of question because in order to do so it is necessary to study in detail the effects of radiation on cells that are hit directly by a radiation beam and those that are not. Most experimental systems cannot distinguish between the two. This study has been designed to try to begin to address some of these issues. We think we can do this because of evidence that has been reported recently that supports the idea that cells communicate with each other after radiation and that this influences which cells die. In some experiments this communication happens when the fluid surrounding irradiated cells is transferred to non-irradiated cells and causes damage to the non-irradiated ones. In other experiments the cells next to irradiated cells have been shown to be damaged even if they have not been hit by the X-ray beam. We do not know how these effects are transferred between cells or whether similar effects occur in brain tumour cells and normal brain cells. However if this is the case, changing these responses could be a completely new way of altering how tumours and normal brain react to radiation. At The Gray Cancer Institute we have a very long history in investigating the effects of radiation on cells and tissues. We have studied the effects of radiation on human tumour cells grown in the laboratory and grown as tumours in experimental animals in detail. It is clear that these systems do not always reflect what happens in a real tumour. This may be partly because of cell-cell interactions that we have never taken in to account. In this study we want to look very carefully for these sorts of cell-cell interactions. We will be able to do this in several different ways. We will look at the effects of irradiation on surrounding cells in populations where all the cells are the same, for example they are all the same tumour cells or all the same normal brain cells. We will also look at what happens when there is a mixture of different cells in the same experiment, for example brain tumour cells surrounded by normal brain cells. We will investigate these effects in two main ways. The first will be to transfer the fluid from around irradiated cells onto unirradiated cells and measure the effects on cell survival and chromosome (gene) damage. The second will be to use the unique facility of the 'micro-beam' that is available at The Gray Cancer Institute to target only certain cells with a highly focussed radiation beam. This means that we will know which cells in an experimental dish have been hit with a radiation beam and which have not. We can therefore compare the damage in hit and nonhit cells. This is possible because of the ability of the micro-beam to target individual cells to be irradiated. For the results of these experiments to be useful we also need to identify how these cells are communicating with each other. We already know some of the ways that cells can do this. Often it is by production of molecules - usually proteins that are secreted from the cell and act as messengers to surrounding cells. Several of these proteins have already been identified and are known to affect cell survival in the brain. They are called cytokines. Since we know what some of these proteins are, we will be able to test for levels of these proteins around cells that have been irradiated to see if they are part of the cell messenger system that occurs after radiation. We will also be able to test the effects of blocking the action of some of these proteins using drugs that are known to stop them acting on the cell. W e may therefore start to get an idea of drugs or types of drugs that could be used to influence whether tumour cells and normal brain cells die after radiation or not. Most of the work in this study will be carried out using human cells that can be grown in the laboratory in dishes or flasks. These systems will be able to tell us quite a lot about how the cells communicate but still will not be strictly the same as a tumour or normal brain cell in an animal. The final part of this project will be to begin to develop animal models that may be useful to test for these effects in systems that are closer to the real situation. This will involve testing new ways of targeting X-ray beams very specifically in animals, for example by using implantable X-ray sources or a system similar to the microbeam that could accurately target a very small X-ray beam on specific areas of tumour or normal brain. We would then be able to test the effects of targeted irradiation on the molecules that we think may change cell survival in a more realistic model and, conversely test how blocking the effects of these proteins affects the tumour or brain response to radiation. This study represents a completely novel approach to understanding what makes cells sensitive to radiation. It may therefore provide new means of enhancing the response of tumours to radiation or of protecting normal brain tissue.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Gray Cancer Institute - Mount Vernon Hospital', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002067\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '281,979', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

It occurs most frequently between 5 and 10 years of age, and accounts for 20-30% of all pediatric brain tumors. Medulloblastoma is an extremely aggressive tumor, and is usually treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. While these approaches are often effective at shrinking the primary tumor, recurrence and metastasis are common, and only 50% of medulloblastoma patients survive for 5 years after diagnosis. Even survival may be a mixed blessing, since treatment of children with radiation and chemotherapy can often impair intellectual and physical development and increase the risk of other cancers later in life. New approaches to the treatment of medulloblastoma are clearly necessary, and may only come from a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of this disease. An important step towards understanding the molecular basis of medulloblastoma has come from studies of a gene called patched. Patched normally functions to inhibit the proliferation of cells in the cerebellum, and when it is mutated cells may proliferate too much. In fact, many people with medulloblastoma have mutations in patched, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in tumor formation. Moreover, mice with patched mutations develop tumors that resemble human medulloblastoma, and have become an important model for studying the disease. But having a mutation in patched does not necessarily mean that one will develop medulloblastoma: only 15% of patched mutant mice (and only 3-5% of people with mutations in this gene) end up developing tumors. These findings suggest that other genes besides patched must be involved in the formation of medulloblastoma. In order to identify these genes, we will take advantage of a unique property of patched mutant mice. Although only 15% of these animals develop brain tumors, about 50% have patches of abnormal cells in their cerebellum. These cells resemble medulloblastoma cells in their location and appearance, but have not yet acquired all the characteristics of medulloblastoma. By studying these \"pre-tumor cells\" we can learn about the earliest and most critical changes that are necessary for a normal cell to develop into a medulloblastoma. In this application we propose to isolate pre-tumor cells from patched mutant mice and determine how they differ from normal cells and from tumor cells. We will examine the behavior of pre-tumor cells in culture, to determine whether they have defects in the ability to control proliferation or in the ability differentiate or die. In addition, we will identify the genes that change as normal cells develop into pre-tumor cells and then into tumors, since these genes are likely to play critical roles in medulloblastoma formation. To test the importance of these genes, we will introduce them into normal animals and see if they cause brain tumors. Genes that do promote tumor formation in mice would be good candidates for genes that are mutated in human medulloblastoma, and might represent important new targets for medulloblastoma therapy. By understanding the function of these genes and developing ways to specifically disrupt them, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective treatments for medulloblastoma.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Duke University Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002064\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '416,559', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Despite many technological innovations in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy over the past four decades, these tumors remain highly resistant to therapy. In the field of cancer treatment, a significant event is the development of drugs that can target the specific genetic lesions that define the abnormal biology of cancer cells. An example of this is chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a form of a white blood cell cancer that results from a defined genetic mutation. After years of laboratory research, drugs were designed that could counteract the specific effects of this genetic mutation and recent clinical studies have shown this drug to be safe and effective in patients suffering from this disease. Can a similar strategy be applied to brain tumors? The genetic basis of brain tumor development is poorly understood. A major insight however was the recognition that activating mutations of the \"Hedgehog\" signal transduction pathway can result in pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma. In fact, medulloblastoma is the most common solid tumor in children, and typically presents at ages 2-5 yrs. The cancer derives from cells of the cerebellum, a part of the brain involved in movement coordination. While survival is possible in up to 60% of cases, the combination of neurosurgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy that is required to save the patient usually results in life long neurological handicap. The need for better drugs designed to counteract the genetic mutations of the Hedgehog pathway are essential to reduce the significant mortality and morbidity associated with medulloblastoma. In Dr. Rowitch's laboratory, novel genetic targets of Hedgehog signal transduction have been identified using a model of the developing mouse cerebellum. Interestingly, many of the targets identified in this animal model system are expressed in human medulloblastoma. One example of these is N-Myc, a known oncogene. An oncogene can confer properties of a cancer cell. Oncogenes typically are involved in regulation of the cell cycle, which determines whether a cell will divide to produce more daughter cells, or stop dividing and differentiate. Dr. Rowitch's lab has found that N-myc is a gene that is induced and/or activated by Hedgehog signal transduction in the developing cerebellum. In this research proposal, Dr. Rowitch will identify the way in which Sonic hedgehog works through N-myc to produce proliferation in the developing cerebellum and in cerebellar brain tumors. It is anticipated that the proposed work will identify novel interactions of Hedgehog signaling both within the cell and between cells during development and that it may provide clues for new therapeutic interventions in human tumors.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002062\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Under these conditions you will only be able to observe a few flickering pixels making it very hard to tell anything about the global shapes on the screen. If an analogy can be drawn between the brain and a TV screen, with the activity of individual neurons corresponding to the changes in color and intensity of individual pixels, then until recently studies of brain activity could only be done under conditions similar to the ones described above. Such studies have led to very important progress towards understanding the response properties of individual neurons. However, it is the coordinated interactions across networks of neurons that hold the secrets of information processing in the brain, just like the plot of the movie in the above example can only be deciphered by observing the spatial and temporal structure in the activation of multiple pixels. There are three basic ingredients to making further progress in understanding the organization of network activity in the brain: (1) reliably isolate the activity of individual neurons (make sure we are observing single pixels, rather than an out of focus mixture of several pixels, thus obtaining a sharp image), (2) obtain stable recordings from the same neurons across long-periods of time (make sure we are observing the same pixels over time, thus obtaining a stable image), and (3) simultaneously record the activity of multiple neurons in multiple brain areas (track many pixels from many parts of the screen at the same time, thus obtaining a larger, more representative image). The recent development of the technique of tetrode electrophysiological recordings has made experiments that satisfy all three of the above requirements possible. Using this technique we plan to study the network mechanisms underlying memory formation, a cognitive process that is fundamental to shaping perception and guiding future action. The natural focus of our studies is the hippocampus, a brain structure that acts as a memory making unit in the brain. This surprising fact was discovered in a famous clinical case, the case of patient H.M., who had bilateral removal of his hippocampus in order to relieve epileptic seizures. This hippocampal damage resulted in profound and surprising memory deficits which manifested themselves in two major ways: (1) No new long-term memories of facts and events could be formed after hippocampal damage, and (2) memories before hippocampal damage were affected in proportion to their recency with very distant memories completely unaffected. These effects of hippocampal damage were confirmed in numerous other clinical cases and experiments with animals and led to two main conclusions about the role of the hippocampus in memory formation: (1) The hippocampus is indeed critical for forming new long-term memories, and (2) memories are not stored in the hippocampus, since distant past memories are not affected by hippocampal damage. If memories are not stored in the hippocampus, where are they are actually stored? The predominant conjecture is that memories are distributed throughout the cerebral cortex with different cortical areas holding different aspects of the memory trace. For example, when watching a movie, the colors and shapes on the screen generate specific activity patterns in your visual cortical areas, while the movie sound generates specific activity patterns in your auditory cortical areas. To make a memory of this experience these activity patterns across the different cortical areas would have to be selectively linked into a coherent whole (memory) that can later be retrieved as a unit and used to guide behavior or be linked to novel activity patterns. The process of linking of activity patterns to form distributed memory traces across cortical areas is orchestrated by the hippocampus. Hence, understanding how the hippocampus interacts with cortical brain areas is the key to understanding the process of memory formation. The direct experimental study of these interactions has only recently become feasible through the technique of tetrode recordings. Using this technique, we will record the simultaneous activity of large numbers of hippocampal and cortical neurons during learning as well as during the sleep periods preceding and following experience. Our goal is to characterize the structure in the language of cortico-hippocampal communication: the basic alphabet and words in this language and the fundamental rules of the underlying grammar. In our previous experimental work we have already begun identifying some of the basic elements in this language. We want to build on our understanding of the structure of cortico-hippocampal interactions to characterize their role in shaping neuronal activity patterns, and their relationship to learning and behavioral performance. To understand the link between network interactions, memory formation, and behavior in a rigorous and quantifiable way we will concentrate on the study of simple associations between sensory stimuli, such as a tone and an eye-blink inducing stimulus, under conditions that can be experimentally precisely controlled. Depending on how the stimuli are arranged in time the learning of these associations can be independent from or critically dependent on the hippocampus. Hence by manipulating the temporal relationships between the stimuli we can systematically study the hippocampal involvement in the establishment of memories of these associations. Critical for understanding complex systems such as the brain is the ability to combine quantitative observations of the system with controlled manipulations of the underlying circuitry. To this end we will combine large-scale recordings with both pharmacological and genetic manipulations. Rodents provide an extremely powerful system for combining these different levels of analysis, from the molecular and cellular, to systems, and behavioral. Characterizing the effects of pharmacological and genetic manipulations on the organization of network neuronal activity can have important implications for understanding the etiology of neurological disorders affecting memory, such as Alzheimer's disease. Memory formation is at the core of the mechanisms of information processing in the brain, which appear to be drastically different from the mechanisms employed in our current theories of computation. In particular, in current digital computers there is a conceptual and practical separation between computation and memory. This makes storing information fast as it just consists of simply writing it to disk or moving it to memory chips. What becomes extremely difficult is maintaining associations among heterogeneous yet related types of information and retrieving them in a content and context dependent fashion. This is the reason why, while we have computers that beat grand masters in chess, we still can't build them to effectively recognize faces as well as a small child can. In the brawn associations and context based retrieval of memories and computation are almost automatic. This is because the circuits that do the computations are the very circuits that are shaped to hold the memories that we extract from experience with all their associations to our previous knowledge. This makes certain types of computations extremely fast, at the cost of making it non-trivial to insert new memories since they have to be gracefully integrated with previously stored information. Nature has evolved an impressive process for integrating new memories in cortical networks that is orchestrated by the hippocampus. Understanding this process will undoubtedly have profound influences on information technology and on our understanding of the nature of computation itself.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'California Institute of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002084\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '445,120', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

It affects up to 85% of right hemisphere stroke patients in the acute phase and 69% in the rehabilitation phase. Neglect is often accompanied by \"extinction\", a paradigmatic example of how stimuli can compete for conscious awareness, whereby patients lose awareness of contralesional stimuli when ipsilesional stimuli are presented concurrently. The neglect syndrome is characterised by severed awareness of sensory inputs from the left affected space, even though there may be no primary sensory loss. Patients fail to orient and respond to stimuli, often behaving as if the left side of their conscious experience no longer exists. The real-life implications of neglect can be devastating, with patients failing to eat food off the left side of their plate, only dressing the right half of their bodies, and not recovering as well as expected from stroke-related motor deficits. Promising rehabilitation techniques have recently become available (e.g., prism adaptation and brain stimulation), but their potential is limited because the pathophysiological mechanisms of neglect and extinction are still poorly understood. Here, I propose a research program that is focused around the competitive feature of spatial sensory perception, something which remains largely unaddressed despite it being at the core of the pathophysiology of neglect. Healthy people are not as good at perceiving double simultaneous compared to single stimuli, suggesting extinction following stroke may be a pathological exacerbation of a physiological competitive perceptual mechanism. The program builds upon this physiologically limited capacity of the normal brain and is articulated around four main branches: 1) exploiting this limited capacity phenomenon to characterise the cognitive and neural processes of normal and pathological spatial awareness; 2) pursuing a multisensory perspective (neglect and extinction do not only occur in the visual domain), 3) providing an animal model of physiological and pathological spatial awareness, and 4) developing new therapeutic interventions based on brain stimulation and pharmacological agents. The findings of this research program will have important implications within both basic and applied research fields. They will substantially contribute to our understanding of the fundamental principles governing human competitive perception of multisensory inputs in the normal brain. The proposed approach, in which identical behavioral paradigms will be applied to healthy and brain-damaged subjects, as well as neurologically intact and temporarily lesioned animals, will provide a full comparative dataset concerning clinically-relevant cognitive processes and their underpinning neuronal mechanisms. In terms of rehabilitation, the physiological mechanisms of currently used therapies will be identified by examining their effects on competitive perception. In the longer term, new brain-stimulation and pharmacological interventions will also be tested. These advances will be readily exploitable for the development of new neuroscience-driven approaches for the treatment of deficits in spatial awareness.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'INSERM (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale)', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020235\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

How could so many unlikely mutations create something as intricate as an eye or a wing? Biologists can only answer that nature had billions of years, so such things are possible. This answer is wholly unsatisfactory. Can anyone explain why the eye evolved over billions of years, rather than millions? Or trillions? These questions are hopelessly broad. Yet even in very simple and well-defined circumstances, surprisingly little is known about what is possible in evolution, over what timescales and in which conditions. In the early 1900s, R. A. Fisher, Sewall Wright, J.B.S. Haldane, and many others studied the basic forces driving evolution. They analyzed simple models of general processes, such as genetic drift and natural selection. This work forms the basis for decades of subsequent work in population genetics, but it is limited primarily to situations where natural selection is absent, or where selection acts on only one or two things at a time. Yet in a wide range of primarily asexual populations such as viruses and microbes, selection faces a crucial problem: there is too much going on at once. Many mutations are often present simultaneously in these populations, some of them beneficial and others deleterious. If natural selection could act on them all independently, it could keep all of the good while eliminating the bad, and the population would quickly adapt. But it cannot. A mutation cannot increase or decrease in frequency without all the other mutations in that particular chromosome doing the same; these mutations are physically linked. Mutations are constantly occurring in a variety of linked combinations, and selection can only act on these combinations as a whole. This reduces the efficiency of natural selection and can place enormous constraints on how these populations can evolve. Sex allows biology to avoid this problem by mixing up chromosomes and causing recombination within them. This breaks the linkage between mutations and allows each to be selected on its own merits. But even in obligately sexual organisms, recombination occurs at most at a few points within each chromosome per generation, so sex only slowly mixes up genomes. In asexual organisms such as viruses and microbes, including many pathogens, linkage is even more extensive. In these populations selection acts on multiple linked variants at once, and evolutionary dynamics are radically different from the usual intuition. I propose to develop theoretical frameworks to study selection acting on these asexual populations. My first aim is to study evolutionary dynamics, to better understand what evolution can do in an asexual population. The basic question is simple: given a particular fitness landscape - that is, a set of possible evolutionary pathways, each characterized by a set of mutations with given mutation rates and selection strengths - what is the probability that a population will take a particular trajectory and what is the rate at which it will do so? We need a quantitative understanding of this question if we hope to learn from what we see in the evolution of natural and experimental populations. For example, what does it mean if a set of experimental yeast populations maintained in identical conditions evolve in very similar (or very different) ways? What precisely does that tell us about the space of possible evolutionary pathways that were available to these populations? How should the result depend on population size or other details of the experiments? Despite much work on this subject, understanding of these questions remains limited. The central difficulty is that the evolution of the population as a whole is an emergent property, arising out of the interactions between mutations at many different loci. Each mutation follows the relatively simple rules of selection and genetic drift, but many mutations act together nonlinearly to determine the patterns of evolution at a population level. Since rare mutational events can have a dramatic impact when they are amplified by selection, stochastic fluctuations are often crucial. Methods common in theoretical population genetics have struggled to understand how the dynamics of the system at large emerges from the basic laws governing individual mutations. To address this problem, I have developed methods combining explicit stochastic analysis of rare types with the statistical behavior of large numbers of non-independent random processes. These techniques allow us to understand how nonlinear population-level dynamics affect the stochastic dynamics of individual mutants, and then self-consistently determine how these individual results add up to produce the correct population-level dynamics. I now propose to build on this framework to analyze evolutionary dynamics in the presence of linkage. These methods may also be of broad applicability to related problems in complex systems involving dynamics across multiple scales. This theoretical work will help us understand how populations evolve given a particular fitness landscape. It remains to ask what such fitness landscapes typically look like. To address this question, I propose to complement my theoretical work with experimental evolution in budding yeast. I have constructed a set of yeast strains which allows us to directly observe particular classes of beneficial mutations as they occur and spread through populations. This allows us to correlate changes in phenotypic characteristics, such as increases in fitness, with the observed dynamics of particular mutants. I will use this in combination with high-throughput methods of strain maintenance, which I have recently developed to allow the simultaneous evolution of thousands of experimental lines. This view of evolutionary dynamics in a massively parallel setting will allow me to explore the relative probabilities of a large set of possible evolutionary trajectories, using the information contained in the variation between identically evolved lines. From this we will be able to infer the structure of underlying fitness landscapes. Despite its advantages, experimental evolution may not always be representative of evolution in the wild. Thus I also plan to study how selection acts in natural populations, based on the signatures it leaves in sequence data. An extensive body of work has been devoted to this subject, resulting in numerous inference techniques. By and large, these techniques are based on knowing what patterns of genetic variation would look like if everything were neutral. Population geneticists then find ways to look for deviations from these neutral expectations in a direction which suggests particular selective forces. But with a few limited exceptions, there are no models of what sequence variation should look like in the presence of selection on linked selected sites. Thus when population geneticists look for selection, they do not know precisely what they are looking for. This makes it hard to find the most powerful ways to distinguish selection from other evolutionary forces. I plan to develop explicit models describing how selection shapes the statistics of genetic variation in asexual populations, which will make it possible to systematically develop more powerful methods for interpreting sequence data. The main difficulty in developing these models is that because mutations are linked, selection at one site can affect the genetic variation at another. I plan to use my earlier analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of linked beneficial and deleterious mutations as a basis for solving this problem. These models describe how variation in fitness within a population is created and maintained. I propose to study how this variation in fitness is determined by the collective dynamics of many lineages of individual mutants. Each lineage is founded by a single mutation, fluctuates in frequency due to selection and genetic drift, and may spawn further lineages with additional mutations. We can calculate the statistics of the frequencies of these lineages, and then trace the mutational ancestry of each lineage. This ancestry tells us whether two mutations occur in the same individual, and hence whether selection at one of those sites affected genetic variation at the other. This makes it possible to calculate the full distribution of genetic diversity within the population. We will test these results by sequencing our experimental yeast lines, relating this data to the known selective events within those populations. I hope that our understanding of the expected patterns of genetic diversity within selected asexual populations will form the basis for more powerful and efficient methods of learning about evolutionary histories from sequence data. Together, these theoretical and experimental approaches will provide a deeper understanding of how natural selection shapes the evolution of asexual populations despite the constraints imposed by linkage. Our theoretical work treats this evolution as a multi-scale system, linking the dynamics of individual mutants with the population-level behavior that they collectively determine. This approach develops general tools which may be widely useful for the analysis of complex systems involving both nonlinearities and stochastic fluctuations on multiple scales. In the process, it lays a basis for understanding and interpreting evolution in both natural and experimental populations.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Harvard University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020225\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '449,113', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Such complexity reveals itself in the unpredictable changes in weather patterns, the swirls of planetary gases and even the bubbling of soup on the stove. But likely even more complex than the physical world around us is the world within us, namely the realm of physiology. Complexity, whether in the physical or physiologic worlds, is fundamentally different from \"complicatedness.\" In everyday language, the terms 'complex' and 'complicated' are often used interchangeably. But, scientifically, they refer to very different types of structures and dynamics. As an example, modern machines can be exceptionally complicated, even with the user's manual. However, the flocking behavior of birds, the music of Mozart, and even the dynamics of the human heartbeat observed at rest or during sleep, are inherently complex. Furthermore, not all types of variability are equally complex. My colleagues and I have shown that the erratic changes in the heart's beating associated with a very common cardiac rhythm disturbance called atrial fibrillation are, paradoxically, less complex than the much more subtle heartbeat fluctuations associated with normal cardiac activation. What are the properties that make some systems complex and not just complicated?

A key feature of healthy biologic systems is their capacity to adapt - to tune their dynamics and even re-sculpt their anatomies to cope with environments that are usually unpredictable and often dangerous or destructive. The marvelous plasticity of the human brain after stroke is one example of a recuperative type of adaptive capacity. The ability of world-class skiers to navigate the turns and twists of the slalom course at extreme speed is another. The term, and the foundational conceptual framework, of , was proposed and developed by Professor John H. Holland at the University of Michigan and his colleagues. This linkage between adaptability and complexity underlies my efforts to probe systems in health and their breakdown with a variety of pathologies. From a dynamical viewpoint, the properties that enable this type of creative adaptability have esoteric names that make them seem unusual and even abnormal. These properties include (things do not add up), (things do not sit still), the lack of a single or characteristic scale (one finds fractal or tree-like organization) and (statistically improbable) dynamics and spatial patterns. Yet, without these negative sounding features, life would not be possible. Translated into more accessible language, nonlinearity refers to systems that do not respond in a way that is proportional to the amount they are stimulated or perturbed. Small changes can have huge effects (\"the straw that broke the camels back\") and conversely, large perturbations may induce only minor changes. Nonlinearity, however, does not imply anarchy; nonlinear systems do have organizing, discoverable principles. The challenge, reflecting the initial quote from Stephen Hawking, is that these principles cannot be uncovered by the traditional reductionist strategy in which scientists dissect a system into its constituent pieces, study each component in detail, and finally put them back together in an attempt to recreate the original entity. Reductionism, while essential to science, is not sufficient to provide a full understanding of systems that are nonlinear. In everyday parlance, nonlinearity is responsible for the familiar notion of . In the technical language of complex systems, it is known by the term emergent properties. For nonlinear systems, the composite or group behavior (of molecules, cells, organs, flocks of birds and human societies) cannot be fully understood by simply adding up the components. Nonlinearity requires rigorous, new approaches to measuring and modeling the behavior of both mathematical and \"real-world\" living systems. A relatively recent development central to this proposal has been the reexamination of system dynamics in the context of health and disease. Not unexpectedly, healthy and pathologic systems have very different dynamical patterns. Particularly compelling from my perspective is the finding that certain features appear to be common, and perhaps even universal, to the dynamics of health and disease, respectively. Further, quantitative analysis of systems that have become dysfunctional reveals certain themes (dynamical signatures) that emerge in contexts as seemingly different as those regulating the heartbeat and the immune system. A continuing source of surprise to me in my own investigations, which scale up from red blood cell motions on the microscopic level to human balance studies on the macroscopic level, is the presence of 1) similar patterns of complexity in different types of healthy, adaptive systems, and 2) the breakdown or even frank collapse of complexity with disease and biotoxicity. Whether these physiologic principles apply at even larger scales, namely at societal and ecosystem levels, is an intriguing possibility. On a practical level, more basic understanding and advanced computational tools point the way to new ways to monitor health status, measure the aging process, detect drug toxicity and forecast catastrophic events such as seizures and sudden cardiac death, as well as the need for life-saving interventions in trauma victims. These computational tools also hold the promise to provide a new class of \"dynamical assays\" to rapidly screen and test new therapeutic interventions designed to restore complexity and enhance system adaptiveness.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020226', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '235,310', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Yet when we consider the consequences in terms of net years of disability and years of life lost, pediatric cancer's impact on public health is disproportionate to its incidence. Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in childhood and radiotherapy (RT) is the mainstay for the treatment of many brain tumors in children. While achieving increased rates of long-term survival, this has come at some risk to the development of these children. It has been estimated that children treated with radiation for medulloblastoma, for example, on average suffer a decline in intelligence on the order of a standard deviation (15 IQ points) over a 4 year period in one study2. To put this in perspective, this corresponds to a decline from the 50th to the 16th percentile in global cognitive functioning, which is a substantial, irreversible change in cognitive functioning with major implications for educational achievement and adaptive success in all areas throughout the lifespan. A recent paper by Ris et. al.,3 reported the long-term outcomes of adult survivors of pediatric brain tumors and found that, compared to healthy siblings, survivors were less likely to be fully employed, have a college education, and earning over $20,000 per year. Survivors also reported higher levels of global distress and depression than their siblings. This portends a life of challenges to children treated for brain tumors that could be partially averted and/or mitigated by improved treatments informed by research of the type proposed here. Improving our understanding of the factors that place these children at higher or lower risk for late-effects is critical to informing the development of less toxic treatments. At the human level, changes in imaging following radiotherapy and how these relate to neurobehavioral morbidity is only generally understood. For example, changes in cerebral white matter have been correlated with IQ declines4. Ongoing research, including an NCI sponsored R01 by one of the co-investigators (DM. Ris) is aimed at relating imaging changes over time to subsequent neurodevelopment in a sample of children treated for brain tumors. This line of research would be greatly enhanced by an animal model of radiation effects on behavior, as proposed here. For example, recent research suggests that preservation of the neural stem cell compartments in irradiated rats may improve behavioral outcome on such tasks as the Morris water maze5. Further, reseach has shown that exercise enhances brain health by reducing inflammation6, increasing angiogenesis7 and enhancing proliferation and survival of neuronal progenitors8. Thus, exercise may counteract radiation-induced decrements in hippocampal neurogenesis5. The discovery of early imaging markers of behavioral toxicity will contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of late-effects as well as early interventions that might mitigate these effects. Such a coordinated program can design and investigate neurobehavioral end-points in animals that correlate with imaging markers as well as align with the neurobehavioral phenotype of children treated with radiation (e.g. deficits in attention, working memory, and processing speed). A translational paradigm of pediatric brain tumors with behavioral end-points executed in conjunction with research at the human level is virtually unprecedented and promises new discoveries of the pathophysiology, prediction, and intervention for late-effects in children treated for brain tumors. Specific aims: 1. We will test the hypothesis that late cognitive changes are related to imaging markers of radiation toxicity. 1.1. We will identify imaging predictive signatures of cognitive changes using a fractionated irradiation scheme (we will test two different schemes as outlined in the design section). 1.2. The model will include the effect of tumor presence on treatment side effects thereby providing us with a preclinical tool to test interventions that can abrogate treatment side effects. 1.3. To achieve our goal we will correlate time of onset and kinetics of imaging changes to pathological and neurocognitive changes. When completed aim 1 would have established: i) a set of imaging markers of RT-toxicity; ii) pathological markers of neurogenesis impairment; iii) a set of cognitive tests in which we have charted the time course of significant changes in cognition. 2. We will test the hypothesis that exercise will reduce radiation-induced brain microvascular inflammation, limit neurogenesis impairment and cognitive decline and that these changes can be detected using our imaging markers established in aim 1. 2.1. Establish our exercise regimen. 2.2. Conduct cognitive and behavioral measurements following exercise regimen. 2.3. Measure the histological effect of exercising on radiation-induced neurogenesis impairment. When completed aim 2 would have: i) tested the predictive power of our set of imaging markers; ii) tested the role of exercise in reversing radiation-induced cognitive decline; iii) investigated the role of exercise in protecting neurogenesis in subjects treated with cranial-RT.  strong>BACKGROUND The effects of irradiation on brain tissue are characterized on the basis of clinical deficits and associated with vascular and parenchymal damage. This damage is mediated by host and treatment related factors and the inherent sensitivities of specific functional anatomic compartments. We have developed a braintumor model that is useful in studying RT side effects. Our model uses C6-GFP glioma cells implanted in the rat brain and irradiated using a hypo-fractionation RT scheme. In the model untreated C6 implanted rats die within 20 days of tumor injection while RT treated animals survive with almost no loss. This RT-response offers a clinically relevant RT toxicity model that allows us to study the combined effect of tumor and RT on brain tissue. RT-induced central nervous system injury is usually divided into three categories: acute (within days), early (1-6 months post treatment), and late. Late RT damage is associated with changes in neuropsychometric or neuroendocrine function, and vascular events9. Brain tumor patients treated with cranial RT have been reported to suffer from late-term toxicity such as decreases in motor/sensory coordination, altered hypothalamic hormone levels, delayed growth and development, IQ deficits, memory loss, behavioral problems, and lower academic achievement10. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that RT dose and volume influence cognitive outcomes11-13. The chronological division of RT injury does not necessarily reflect a mechanistic disparity14-16. Late RT injury is likely to be related to early events that initiate a cascade of events leading to the observed changes 17,18. We, and others, have shown that RT induces an inflammatory response as indicated by an increase in TNF-α, ICAM-1 signaling, and astrocyte activation in the brain 19-22 after treatment with single and fractionated RT23,24. Prolonged gliosis can create glial scar sites, which has been theorized to inhibit axonal regeneration or remyelination25,26. We22,27 have demonstrated that this inflammation response is related to an increase in blood brain-barrier permeability following RT, and that it is abrogated when treated with TNF-α or ICAM-1 mAbs22. Neurogenesis is a highly regulated process that is affected by a widespread variety of exogenous and endogenous stimulus28-32. It has been shown that RT has a detrimental effect on neurogenesis33,34. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus has been implicated in learning and memory. Neurogenesis is reported to be important for spatial learning,35,36 which is a hippocampal-dependent task 37,38. DG is particularly adapted to maintain and transmit the information received from the enthorinal cortex, specifically aimed to encode small inputs into the place cells within the hippocampal circuitry. Thus, impaired neurogenesis can easily be tested by Morris water maze, a well-established behavioral paradigm for spatial learning. Ablation of hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents by different means (genetic, pharmacological, or RT) results in lower scores in tasks that involve memory and learning. GH deficiency is usually caused by the loss of growth hormone-releasing hormone neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the condition tends to worsen over time39. The true incidence of GH deficiency after central nervous system (CNS) RT is unknown; however, evidence suggests that hypothalamic RT at doses at or >2Gy will impair GH release40 and that doses used to treat primary brain tumors (>50Gy) will often result in GH deficiency41. The long-term goal of our work is two fold. First, we want to identify a set of imaging markers of radiation side effects that are predictive of cognitive impairment. Second, we will use our imaging/cognitive paradigm to test interventions that can ameliorate these cognitive deficits and protect the brain against late RT-induced toxicity. To achieve this goal, the PI has assembled a strong interdisciplinary team which put together the current proposal. This project will be used as a springboard to construct the imaging/cognitive model and build future collaborations with oncologists, geneticists, and drug developers to achieve the long-term goal stated above.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Baylor College of Medicine', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020250\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This theory of language cognition has been tested on adjectives (e.g., colors), nouns (e.g., containers), and function words (e.g., pronouns) primarily through static stimuli. However, language cognition in the real world involves talking about dynamic processes that are perceived through multi-sensory integration, embodied, and acted upon. Here, we propose to study such dynamic language cognition through the lens of verb meanings: Do verb meanings across languages represent body movements in ways that allow efficient communication about these dynamic processes in the world? We aim to understand the cognitive constraints and computational principles that shape the ways in which humans use language to represent movements. More specifically, we aim to study how native speakers of different languages use verbs to describe movements, and how they comprehend verb meanings by demonstrating movements. These questions pose two open challenges. First, in contrast to other semantic domains, which have often been grounded in static elements of the environment, verbs refer to dynamical processes that are a result of multi-sensory perception-action loops which are much harder to characterize. Second, in order to test theories about language for movement, we need large-scale cross-linguistic production and comprehension data which does not currently exist. Here, we propose to address these open challenges by (1) using state-of-the-art computational models of motor control to develop a locomotion meaning space and generate from it a large dynamic stimulus set; (2) collecting large-scale cross-linguistic verb production and comprehension data with respect to our stimulus set; (3) supplementing theses data with in-lab experiment to measure the motion and forces as individuals demonstrate their comprehension of locomotion verbs; and (4) generating theory-driven predictions by integrating the computational locomotion models with the computational framework of efficiency in language, and then testing these predictions on our newly collected data. Our proposed work will help develop a theory of language cognition that is more naturalistic by seeking to encompass meanings that represent the dynamic and multi-sensory processes involved in locomotion. This proposal builds on the team's complementing expertise in computational psycholinguistics and the cognitive science of language (PI Levy), information theory and cross-language semantic variation (Dr. Zaslavsky), and computational modeling of human motor control (Dr. Seethapathi), in addition to the expertise of all collaborators in contemporary machine learning methods.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3942', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Importantly, much evidence shows that these views (be they stereotypical or more rationally founded) are shared across members of specific social groups (members of political parties are a good example). The methods we will be using are derived from well-known laboratory methods and involve collecting lists of things that can be predicated from a given concept (e.g., things that somebody believes to be typically true about “nature”, “recycling”, “terrorism”, and many other concepts). In contrast to other existing methods for studying socially shared world views (for example, polls and surveys), we are working towards developing a method that allows theoretically founded and statistically sound data collection and data analyses to an extent that goes beyond currently available research methods. Our laboratory has already made some strides in that direction, but in the current project we hope to solve some important problems that preclude these methods from reaching their full potential.

Indeed, humans routinely “extend” our minds and make thinking easier by manipulating the external environment. We take notes, set alarms, and use calendars to aid and augment our memories; we turn to calculators when faced with difficult mathematical problems; and we use GPS to navigate through both new and familiar territory, setting the map to match our spatial orientation so that we don’t have to mentally rotate it. With technological innovation soaring exponentially, this general capacity for “cognitive offloading” is becoming increasingly central to modern notions of intelligence. In adults, psychometric measures of intelligence that incorporate the opportunity for cognitive offloading are better at predicting real-world outcomes than traditional measures of intelligence that inherently preclude offloading. Intelligence tests for children, however, which are often used to identify low- and high-capacity students in need of intervention, continue to employ batteries of tasks that preclude offloading. Such tests therefore fail to capture a crucial element of intelligence that might be especially predictive of academic and other measures of success. The proposed project will seek to rectify this issue, by developing the first intelligence test battery with offloading-unavailable and offloading-available versions of each task. Children’s performance on these tasks, as well as their performance on a traditional intelligence test, will then be compared with subsequent academic outcomes. The overarching hypothesis is that children’s performance on the offloading-available tasks will be more strongly correlated with academic outcomes than their performance on the offloading-unavailable tasks, thus providing proof of concept for the incorporation of cognitive offloading into standardised intelligence tests for children. This project has the potential to not only overhaul long-held theoretical assumptions about the nature and development of intelligence, but also lay the groundwork for new assessment tools that can identify children at risk of falling behind their peers (or children who might benefit from accelerated education).", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The University of Queensland', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3781', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Examples of transformative experiences include the gain or loss of sensory capacities, emigrating to a country with a culture very different from one’s own, or becoming a parent for the first time. Having a stable sense of self is crucial for well-being, but transformative experiences can radically disrupt identity in adulthood, well after identity is assumed to be stabilized. It is therefore surprising that transformative experiences have received little attention in identity development research. Here, we seek to close this gap by studying how transformative experiences impact identity and well-being in adulthood. We focus on a canonical and common transformative experience -- becoming a parent for the first time – and address four key questions. First, how do cognitive representations of the self (i.e., self-representations) change during the transition to parenthood? Second, during this transition, do people mold their self-representations to become more closely aligned with their stereotypes of how parents ought to be? Third, how do changes in self-representations during the transition to parenthood relate to well-being? Finally, how do self-representations relate to the stories people tell about meaningful events in their lives, like the transition to parenthood? To address these questions, we combine cutting-edge computational techniques for modeling the content of self-representations with new smartphone-based “experience sampling” technology that can measure people’s cognitive processes as they go about their daily lives in naturalistic social environments. We will longitudinally measure self-representations in three groups of adults: people who are about to become parents for the first time (transformation group), and two control groups (people who want children at some point in the future but are not currently expecting, and current parents who are not expecting more children). Participants in the transformation group will complete the study before and after the arrival of their new child, and participants in control groups will complete the study at matched timepoints to control for any effects of the mere passage of time. Across the study timeline, we will probe identity in three different ways: (1) with a measure of commitment to an identity as a parent; (2) with stories people tell about key moments in their lives; and (3) with a novel task that measures how people represent core dimensions of themselves (like “warmth” and “competence”) and how these dimensions are related over time. The result will be a rich, longitudinal dataset capturing stability and change adult identity over time that has potential to serve as a “Rosetta Stone” for identity research, bridging multiple methods for measuring identity in the same set of participants. This work has potential to break new ground in our understanding of how one of the most common and profound human experiences can shape identity and well-being in adulthood, and can serve as a springboard for future work exploring transformative experiences as noteworthy developmental phenomenon.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Princeton University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3920', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

From climate change to increasingly mobile human populations to the global economy, the relationship between humans and their environment is being modified in ways that will have long-term impacts on ecological health, biodiversity, and system sustainability as well as the viability of local economies. These challenges are perhaps nowhere more evident than in island ecosystems, as they represent both the greatest vulnerability to globalization and also the greatest scientific opportunity to study the impacts of global changes. The diversity and endemism that characterize island ecosystems, such as the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, draw attention to science and conservation, but also highlight the threats to the environment caused by tourism and migration as well as global environmental threats from climate change, invasive species, and such global factors as trafficking in shark fins. In the Galapagos, like many other places around the globe, complexity is anchored in the fact that complex systems are often nested within other complex systems, for example in our case global tourism demands, global climate change, migration primarily from the Ecuadorian mainland reflecting attractions to the Galapagos as well as pushes in certain areas of the mainland, invasive species altering the terrestrial landscape, and the fragile ecology and iconic species of the coastal environment. Incorporating multiple complex systems within a theoretical and modeling approach is challenging, and has not received the attention it deserves given that this is the reality in the empirical world. Within the complexity community, an increasingly popular tool to examine relationships and test scenarios is agent-based models (ABM). An ABM is a type of spatial simulation method that posits equations and other functions describing processes driving social and environmental change and then calibrates the parameters of those relationships to simulate the effects of different forces on outcomes. There are several unique aspects of ABMs that set them apart from more conventional statistical modeling. First, relationships are specified at the micro level. In an ABM, agents, with various attributes, interact with other agents in a dynamic manner via social and spatial networks within a dynamic environment according to a set of algorithms that can be theoretically and/or empirically based. Second, feedback loops and critical thresholds are extensively represented, particularly by allowing potentially nonlinear aggregations of micro behaviors to change larger social units such as communities which, in turn, feedback onto micro behavior. Feedbacks can operate via compositional effects, social networks, spatial relations or through the environment, and can involve learning and adaptation of agents. Third, rather than seeking a statistical or deterministic solution, agent's actions and their effects are solved computationally, allowing the specification of highly nonlinear and complex underlying equations. Stochastic components can be included in the models. Fourth, ABMs allow for analysis of such concepts as synergy, emergence, and tipping points that are more difficult to handle in other approaches. Nevertheless, ABMs remain controversial. One important critique is that, in practice, when an ABM is parameterized and calibrated, it usually does not account for traditional problems of endogeneity, selectivity, measurement error, and uncertainty. Thus ABM simulations lack credibility across significant portions of the social sciences. Further a tension exists between keeping the models simple so that one can “see” the processes operating and making them sufficiently complex so that results have the possibility of mimicking reality, which in turn runs the risk of turning the model into a “black box.” Relatedly, there are open questions about verifying and validating ABMs, in part because there have not been empirical trials with ABMs and statistical approaches using the same data. Also, comparisons across models are difficult because reporting standards have not emerged and ABMs often use algorithms that are difficult to describe using mathematics. Without exaggerating too much, these controversial aspects of ABM-style modeling have led conventional social scientists to largely ignore results from ABM models, made it difficult to publish results from ABM models in the very best social science journals, and made it difficult to obtain funding to collect the appropriate data to better inform ABM models. Within the ecological communities, the situation is not quite so stark. Rather, there the proliferation of diverse ABMs has made it difficult to compare results, and human behavior tends to be treated in an overly simplified manner. We will comprehensively attack these problems with a distinguished interdisciplinary team having expertise in statistical modeling, ABMs, and collecting and analyzing complex social and ecological data. We address parameterization, feedback mechanisms, calibration of equations and algorithms, transparency of the model, reporting standards, uncertainty, and validation issues, and by so doing we will bridge disciplinary linguistic, methodological and conceptual divides. If the results convincingly demonstrate the utility of ABMs for studying complex systems, then the impact on understanding broad-scale social and ecological interactions and change will be profound. The research community will be in a better position to go from micro to macro and then back to micro. If our results confirm skepticism about ABMs, then the proposed research will be instructive to the scientific community and to the parts of NIH and NSF that have been seeking to invest in ABMs and in understanding complex systems more generally. The work proposed here, admittedly at an early stage of development, aims to accomplish two goals. First, using available data supplemented with expert opinion and qualitative data to be collected as part of this project, we will develop an ABM model that has sub-models that incorporate complexity from global tourism, climate change, migration streams, urbanization, invasive terrestrial species, land use/land cover change (LULCC), and the human-environment interactions of a fragile, and increasingly developed, coastal environment. This modeling will not only be a “proof of concept” approach, but will also have results of interest in their own right. Second, we will tackle head-on the skepticism of statistically sophisticated social scientists towards ABM-type models. David Guilkey, a well-known econometrician at the University of North Carolina and a skeptic about the utility of ABMs in causal analysis, will be part of the team designing the ABM. The idea is to highlight all the points at which the ABM we develop is using, data, rules & tools, that would be considered questionable from an econometric perspective, and then, working as a team, design a data collection and analysis approach that could be analyzed both by ABM and econometric experts to see the extent to which the ABM and statistical approaches give similar results, and if not, why not. In short, this is the statistical and modeling equivalent of a “cook off.” Funding for the data collection and analyses for this “cook off” is not part of the present project; rather we would apply to NIH, and possibly NSF for the necessary funds towards the end of this project. The significance of both the proof of concept and being able to bridge the chasm between those using ABM-type models and more conventional statistical models is that serious progress in understanding complex systems will require a better understanding of the strengths and weakness of both approaches, and preferably a functional combination of the two. During the past three decades, dramatic changes have threatened the social and ecological sub-systems of the Galapagos Islands. Beginning in the 1970’s, the Islands have experienced exponential population growth. Thousands of new residents began to migrate from the mainland attracted by the promise of lucrative opportunities linked to the islands’ rich marine and terrestrial ecosystems and “pushed” by the lack of economic opportunities in many parts of mainland Ecuador. The local population has grown from under 10,000 in 1990 to an estimated 35,000 residents today, and the number of tourists has increased from about 41,000 in 1990 to nearly 185,000 by 2010. In 2007, in response to the direct and indirect effects of the expanding human imprint in the Galapagos, UNESCO placed the islands on the “at risk” list of World Heritage Sites, and, similarly, the Ecuadorian Government declared an “ecological emergency” for the islands. While it is obvious at a superficial level that jumps in tourism levels and population migration impact the environment and vice versa, less is known about the explicit pathways through which this occurs. The challenge in moving scientific understanding beyond the obvious is graphically illustrated in Figure 1. The three main elements are land (cover and use), resident population, and tourism. Each influences one another. With causality likely going in both directions, untangling effects is extremely difficult, hence the need to consider both ABMs and structural equation modeling.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020269\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '410,810', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In complex biological and ecological systems synchronization is a widespread phenomena, and some of the most intriguing areas of research in neuroscience include the study of synchrony among far away regions of the brain, and its behavioral meaning. Available evidence suggests that synchronization is also a common process in the earth’s climate, but research on detecting its presence and documenting its consequences is still at a very early stage. Though synchronization has mainly been studied in relatively low-dimensional discrete systems or networks, the possibility of similar dynamics occurring in extended spatiotemporal systems such as the earth’s climate could open an important new interdisciplinary area of research. The climate system is complex, whatever our definition of complexity may be, but if that complexity can be reduced in some measure by detecting and recognizing long-range symmetries caused by synchronization, our understanding of climate dynamics would greatly benefit. If applied to the history of climate, as proposed here, detection of synchronization among paleoclimate time series can likewise benefit climate science by explaining hitherto poorly understood processes. For instance, one challenging problem is to explain the cause(s) of the last ice age’s rapid temperature variations, and whether such abrupt changes in the climate are global, rather than confined to northern latitudes and especially to the Arctic. Examples of the abruptness of climate change are best recorded in Greenland’s stable isotope climate proxies obtained from ice cores. These records exhibit large, sudden warming events (up to 15oC warming in high latitudes, 4-5oC in mid-latitudes) that last from centuries to several millennia, and occurred at least 24 times during the last 100ky (1ky=1000 years). Generally known as the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) temperature fluctuations, the transition to the high temperature state in the DO occurs in a matter of years or decades, and hence the importance of understanding the mechanisms of these events. If the climate system is capable of sudden temperature jumps in timescales comparable to a human life, and without the intervention of humans, it is urgent that we understand why, especially since humans are irresponsibly disturbing the climate system in ways that, it has been suggested, could possibly trigger abrupt climate change. During the last glaciation the climate of the Polar Regions evolved in complicated ways, and as the ice core data from both Greenland and Antarctica reveal, there is suggestive evidence that the climatic fluctuations of the two poles are not independent of each other. For instance, recent highresolution data show that there is a phase shift of one-quarter of a period (π/2) between the southern and northern records that results in that Antarctica warms while Greenland is cold and as Antarctica begins to cool Greenland rapidly warms. This phenomenon has been known among researchers as the bipolar seesaw, though neither its origin, nor that of the phase shift, is clear or understood. The bipolar seesaw hypothesis proposes that anti-phase temperature shifts between the two Polar Regions are likely to be influenced by the Atlantic thermohaline conveyor-like circulation, which massively distributes heat to the two hemispheres. But how the conveyor links the poles, what is the physical meaning of these phase shifts, or what mechanisms cause the seesaw is not known, nor is there a model with enough explanatory power to describe it from first principles. I propose that the simplest explanation of the data is that the paleoclimate oscillations of the Polar Regions are synchronized. To represent polar climate variability I borrow from the work of climatologist Barry Saltzman, who three decades ago showed how climate oscillations of polar temperatures may be explained by the nonlinear interaction between just two variables: sea ice extent and mean ocean temperature. Saltzman’s model explains that mean ocean temperature begins to increase when sea ice reaches its maximum extent. This is because sea ice is a very effective heat insulator, while a large portion of the ocean is still receiving solar heat. Eventually, after several hundred years of diffusive warming, the ocean reaches a threshold temperature that forces sea ice to retreat. As sea ice rapidly retreats polar ward accelerated by the ice-albedo positive feedback the ocean releases its stored heat and slowly cools. When the ocean becomes cold enough, sea ice begins to grow back advancing rapidly equator ward, again accelerated by the ice-albedo positive feedback. This cyclic build up and release of stored thermal energy is best described physically as a relaxation oscillation, and mathematically as the solution to the well-known nonlinear van der Pol differential equation. Saltzman’s two variables play a similar role to that of displacement and velocity in a simple linear pendulum oscillation, only that here the oscillation is a self-sustained, nonlinear one. With a simple synchronization model I can show that polar climates can behave like two nonidentical Saltzman’s oscillators, each subtly influencing and influenced by the other through the intervening ocean and atmosphere, such that eventually their components synchronize to form a global oscillation. The close analogy with Christiaan Huygens’ famous 1673 experiments describing the (nonlinear) synchronization of pendulum clocks is inevitable. As Huygens noted, the clocks, coupled by the weak elastic forces along the wall on which they hung, always became synchronized, no matter how different their starting conditions, and so long as their natural frequencies were not too different. Through the slight motions induced on the wall each clock gently forced the other, speeding it up or slowing it down until synchrony was attained. Even if their coupling was very weak (clocks several meters away from each other), the clocks eventually synchronized to a common frequency (entrainment) and constant phase lock, which could be either in-phase, anti-phase, or out-of phase. The out-of-phase solution is very suggestive, for paleoclimate data does in fact show a π/2 phase lead of Antarctica’s climate oscillation over the Arctic (Figure 1). Moreover, the instantaneous frequencies of the two polar oscillations should be theoretically the same for most of the last ice age, as shown below (see page 4). This means 1:1 frequency entrainment, which along with the π/2 phase lock suggest out-of-phase or lag synchronization. Thus, the oscillations of the two Huygens’ clocks are instructive analogues of the interaction between the climate of the Polar Regions: the wall is the analogue of the intervening ocean and atmosphere, and the weak interaction between the two clocks along the wall is the analogue to meridional heat transfer (diffusion, advection) and mass transport. In the real climate however the ‘clocks’ are usually chaotic and many forms of synchrony may occur, irregular or weak coupling or large detuning (disparity in internal frequencies) may result in only partial, temporary or sporadic (though dynamically important) synchronization. Further, detecting synchrony in paleoclimate data is not simple, requiring special statistical analyses and modeling techniques, some of which will be developed for this project, and some adapted from other disciplines. However, if proven, detection of any such linkages would signify a great advance in the understanding of climate dynamics. Besides the possibility of explaining polar interactions and phase shifts, a major potential benefit of investigating synchronization in the climate system is discovering unifying principles for processes thus far considered distinct and/or unrelated. As mentioned above, one particular process we aim at is the Dansgaard-Oeschger temperature fluctuations of the last ice age. Polar synchronization would imply that the DO are responsive to Antarctic temperature variations, and therefore are not a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon, as generally believed. If they are indeed lag synchronized, Antarctica and Greenland climate proxy records may represent the components of a single global oscillation such that the abruptness of the DO temperature change may ultimately be linked to Antarctica. Another possible example where synchronization is likely to be involved is in climate oscillations that can have enormous impacts (some negative) on the ecosystem and on human life: recent studies show an apparent causal relationship between El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian monsoon that suggests some degree of synchronization. I submit that, dynamically, a key to their long-range interaction may be that ENSO and the Indian monsoon are antipodal to each other (just like the two poles). The earth’s spherical shape has interesting consequences when considering the propagation of climatic influence especially through the atmosphere, as it provides a way to communicate information to the longest distances. Every bit of information released at a source will eventually converge with all other bits (provided it survives dissipation) at their geographic antipode. If the signals are sufficiently strong this process may induce the development of normal modes of climate oscillation, which is a form of global synchronization for wavelengths that fit the earth’s circumference an integer number of times. Thus, it may not be inconsequential to climate dynamics that ENSO and the monsoon (as well as the two Polar Regions) are antipodal to each other.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020273\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '400,340', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Cancer involves defects in the ability of the cell to accurately proof-read DNA during replication, as well as aberrations in the cell signaling pathways that normally transduce information from outside the cell into intracellular compartments and the nucleus. The normal machinery of programmed cell death is disrupted in cancer cells and constitutive activation of catalytic processes short-circuit the elegant signaling network that normally allows a cell to signal that an important change has occurred in the environment to which it must respond. In this feed forward cycle of constantly responding to a perceived stress the deleterious mutations accumulate until a cell becomes transformed. Among the most intractable of cancers are Glioblastoma Multiforms (GBMs), which typically have a poor prognosis and short median survival times. This is a devastating disease and therapeutic options are currently limited. Several obstacles are associated with successful treatment of GBMs. First, these tumors are not encapsulated and, because they are highly invasive, tend to spread to other regions before they are diagnosed. In addition, many conventional chemotherapeutic agents cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not reach the site of malignancy. Several well characterized oncogenic mutations in GBMs are known to cause constitutive activation in lipid signaling pathways. RAS GTPase is frequently mutated in human glioblastomas, leading to activation of PI3Kinase and subsequent activation of Akt. Phospholipase D (PLD) is intimately associated with this pathway. PLD is activated by oncogenic forms of tyrosine kinase receptors, such as EGFR. Phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by PLD is an essential modulator of pathways that directly regulate levels of PI(3,4,5)P . PA is a membrane binding site for Raf kinase and has also been shown to modulate sphingosine kinase and the mTOR pathway. We recently discovered that PLD is in complex with Akt and appears to modulate the phosphorylation state of the kinase. PLD catalytic activity is hyperactivated in human GBMs, but it has not previously been possible to interrogate the therapeutic possibilities of this target. In collaboration with the laboratory of Craig Lindsley we have designed and synthesized the first isoenzyme selective inhibitors of PLD1 and PLD2 (Scott et al., 2009 ) and additional compounds with increased potency and efficacy have been developed. The initial description of these compounds focused on effects in breast cancer cells, but subsequent work identified that human glioblastomas frequently have very high levels of PLD catalytic activity and the effects of the inhibitors on blocking invasiveness are striking ( , below). Preliminary results show that inhibition of PLD generated product, PA, effectively blocks invasive migration of a glioblastoma derived cell line, U87-MG. Our synthesized lead compounds have high selectivity (>1700 for EVJ) and potencies below 1 nM. The goal of this proposal is to refine pharmacological properties of the compounds, define the molecular mechanism of these compounds (i.e. how PLD inhibitors block invasive migration), and optimize the medicinal chemistry to develop a preclinical candidate. The long term goal of this research is to determine whether PLD is an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of GBMs alone and/or if it synergizes with other therapeutic targets to effectively block GBM progression. Our hypothesis operates from the premise that no single agent will be entirely successful unto itself in treating brain cancers, but PLD may be a critical node that leads to more successful therapy. If validated we will seek to partner with a pharmaceutical company to develop our lead compound into a suitable candidate for clinical trials. Support from the McDonnell Foundation will be critical at this phase. The central hypothesis to be tested in this research is that targeted ablation of the signaling pool of PA generated by PLD will be sufficient to significantly block invasive migration of GBMs and in combination with other signaling pathway inhibitors will provide a novel pharmacological agent that can block invasive migration, extend survival times and augment therapeutic treatment. The specific aims include: The overall goal of this research plan is to develop potent (subnanomolar) and highly selective (isoenzyme specific) that minimize off-target effects. The unique approach in our research plan is that novel small molecules are synthesized and immediately screened in two parallel, and highly complementary, approaches. The compounds are screened in a biochemical assay in which only purified PLD1 or PLD2 are present with chemical defined lipid vesicles. This assures that the chemical series is working directly on the phospholipase. The assay details are described in detail (Brown et al., 1993 ; Brown et al., 2007 ). The parallel assay utilizes a cell-based approach in systems in which exclusive PLD1 and PLD2 responses have been established. The cellular PLD transphosphatidylation activity is measured by analysis of the formation of phosphatidylbutanol, which an alternate catalytic product of PLD. Other glycerophospholipid species are monitored in parallel. Off-target effects in other lipid signaling pathways are detected in the analysis of the spectrum. In contrast to many drug-discovery approaches we are able to identify immediately if a new series of compounds is ineffective or has substantial off-target effects. This allows us to rapidly assess SAR and focus on more productive chemical modifications. We have multiple series of compounds that inhibit PLD. Preliminary results reveal that the major effects of these inhibitors are to block invasive migration and promote cell death. Given that GBMs have high levels of constitutively produced PA and a major cause of death due to these tumors is uncontrolled invasiveness, PLD is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Our results have focused in the matrigel invasion assays, but we propose to extend these studies into 3¬dimensional anchorage independent growth assays. A number of relevant biological parameters will also be measured including effects on cell growth, apoptosis, sensitivity to irradiation and other chemotherapeutic agents, endocytosis of EGFR, and changes in metabolic pathways as biomarkers. This will serve as the primary determination for which compounds should be used for analysis of in vivo tumor models. These studies will also provide important information on entry of the inhibitors into brain and subsequent metabolism. The primary and secondary metabolites will be measured by online HPLC-ESI¬MS. Given the complexity of metabolites in glioblastomas, it may be necessary to utilize chemical probes. We have recently developed a new form of Click chemistry in which alkyne-labelled probes can be covalently complexed to cobalt and resolved from other biomolecules. This is essentially “affinity chromatography” for small molecule metabolites (Milne et al., 2010, ). This approach allows us to detect metabolites after prolong periods of treatments with multiple biotransformation steps. This will facilitate our understanding of the metabolic fate of our small molecule inhibitors as well as assess bioactive compounds within the model.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2011', 'amount': '300,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

It took approximately twenty-five thousand years for the first iconic written numerals to emerge among human cultures (e.g., Sumerian cuneiform). Now, children acquire the meanings of verbal counting words, Arabic numerals, written number words, and the procedures of basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction in just six years (between ages 2 and 8). What cognitive abilities enabled our ancestors to record tallies in the first place? And, what cognitive abilities allow children to rapidly acquire the formal mathematics knowledge that took our ancestors many millennia to invent? Our research aims to discover the origins and organization of numerical information in humans using clues from child development, the organization of the human brain, and animal cognition. This essay traces the origins of numerical processing from \"primitive\" numerical abilities to math IQ. Pre-verbal children and non-human animals possess the ability to appreciate quantities, such as the approximate number of objects in a set, without counting them verbally. Instead of counting, children and animals can mentally represent quantities approximately in an analog format, akin to the way in which a machine represents intensities in currents or voltages (1). We have shown that humans and non-human primates share cognitive algorithms for encoding numerical values as analogs, comparing numerical values, and arithmetic. Further, my colleagues and I have shown that the brain regions recruited to perform these tasks are also shared by adult humans, non-human primates, and 4-year-old children who cannot yet count to 30. Recently, we have found that neural regions involved in analog numerical processing are important for the development of math IQ (and not verbal IQ). Taken together, the data implicate a degree of continuity in numerical abilities ranging from primitive approximation to complex and sophisticated math. Although there is general agreement that nonsymbolic, analog numerical estimation is a cognitive antecedent of formal (symbolic) mathematical knowledge, there is considerable debate over how numerical information is organized in the mind. The debate can be distilled down to three main issues. The first issue concerns the role of general-purpose mechanisms in numerical processing. Some researchers hypothesize that domain-general aspects of cognition, such as working memory, provide the critical mechanism that influences the time-course of mathematics learning. Other researchers argue that early-developing, domain-specific properties of numerical processing, such as analog number encoding, permanently impact mathematical understanding throughout development. Second, a recent debate has emerged over the degree to which numerical representations draw on mechanisms from other functionally specialized domains, such as spatial cognition: Does 'space' ground numerical and quantitative concepts or do 'space' and 'number' develop independently? Finally, the degree to which language and formal culture (i.e., schooling) play a unique role in the organization of numerical information in the human brain continues to be unresolved: Which aspects of numerical processing are altered qualitatively by language and human cultural practices? Our current studies aim to address these questions and others using a combination of developmental, neuroimaging, and non-human primate research -- both to understand numerical cognition in its own right and to provide crucial input for educational practices in mathematics.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Rochester', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020300\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Along the trunk, branches and twigs of this tree, genetic information has passed “vertically” from parent to offspring, generation after generation down to the present day. Successive discoveries – first of chromosomes, then genes, then the DNA double helix and genetic code – have revealed in ever-greater molecular detail how this tree is perpetuated and new branches arise. Present-day genes and proteins are documents of this treelike history. Thanks to new technologies that decode these molecular documents and reconstruct the underlying branching patterns, many macroscopic organisms have now been assigned their place in this great Tree of Life. Bacteria, however, continue to fit uncomfortably into this Tree. One hundred years ago Schmitt discovered that agglutination properties of the human paratyphoid bacillus could be heritably changed by exposure to other, unrelated types of bacteria. In 1928 Griffith showed that  non-virulent  pneumococci  could  be  rendered  virulent  by  a  heat-stable  substance extracted from a virulent strain, and in 1944 Avery reported DNA to be the transforming substance. We now know that many bacteria can take up foreign DNA, make it their own and pass it along to successive generations. This alternative mode of transmission, lateral genetic transfer (LGT), is orthogonal to the treelike vertical mode of inheritance described above and now underpins experimental molecular genetics and biotechnology. LGT is at least as significant outside the laboratory, most notably in spreading antibiotic-resistance genes to previously sensitive strains in hospitals, in the community and along the commercial food chain, with worrisome implications for public health in rich and poor societies alike. Only since the late 1990s, however, with the explosion of large-scale genome sequencing, have we begun to appreciate how central LGT is to the bacterial way of life. In some species up to 40% of gene families bear evidence of lateral transfer. Not only antibiotic resistance but core physiology (carbon and nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, ion transport), surface adhesion, host range and antigenic properties owe their distribution among bacteria, at least in part, to lateral processes: LGT is not a sideshow, but shares centre stage with vertical genetics. Importantly, LGT is neither uniform nor random. Upon entering a bacterium from the environment, foreign DNA encounters a succession of molecular systems (host defences) that it may or may not be able to evade or exploit. Some defence systems preferentially ignore  DNA  from  close  relatives  but  destroy  DNA  from  unrelated  species,  others  the opposite; some types of events transfer large multi-gene regions of DNA into the new host, others only small regions that may partly overlap an existing gene, or be contained entirely within it. Some transfer events target and overwrite older ones, others preferentially avoid doing so. Complex systems research offers unique perspectives and tools with which we can examine the consequences of this non-traditional genetics. Like other biological systems, the microbial biosphere can be abstracted as a gigantic network made up of nodes (vertices) connected pairwise by lines (edges). Here, the vertices represent entities that carry DNA (genomes, viruses and plasmids), and the edges represent LGT between them. Of course these networks only approximate reality: many genomes remain un-sequenced and thus lie outside our analysis  (we  accommodate  them  by  assuming  they  lie  along  known  edges).  Rigorous statistical approaches tell us whether an edge should be drawn between any two vertices, and how confident we can be in this decision. By connecting vertices we generate a network map of  LGT  across  the  microbial  biosphere  –  a  map  that  will  grow  ever-more  detailed  as thousands upon thousands more genomes are sequenced, for example in large projects such as GEBA (Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea) and Microbial Earth. Just as LGT is non-random, these network maps are non-uniform. Some vertices (hubs) anchor numerous edges, others only one or two; other vertices form groups interconnected more or less densely. Earlier this year, in an invited review on the lateral spread of antibiotic resistance, we defined a Genetic Exchange Community (GEC) as a densely connected region within an LGT network. That is, GECs are sets of genomes that have, over time, donated genetic material to and received genetic material from each other via a path of lateral transfer. Using concepts from graph theory and powerful computers, we can identify and precisely enumerate GECs even in immense networks. These non-traditional genetic structures in the biosphere can differ widely in geospatial extent, taxonomic and habitat diversity, density of interconnection, and involvement of plasmids or phage; genetic determinants that are benign in one part of a GEC may be pathogenic in another. As we wrote in the review, GECs are “actively fashioned (and continually refashioned) by the complex ongoing interplay among habitats, donors, vectors, recipients, mechanisms, sequences, population structures and selection. In this sense, GECs are analogous to ecological niches: except perhaps in the broadest sense, niches do not exist a priori in the physical world, but are constructed dynamically by organisms through diverse physical, chemical and biological interactions with their environment and with each other. Microorganisms similarly construct GECs, in the process altering the genomes and physiologies of their interaction partners and reciprocally being altered by them (including the ability to differentially accommodate or resist LGT). The recombinant microorganisms may then alter their physical environment or spread to a new one.” In this way the known microbial biosphere, together with its GECs, constitutes a complex evolving system. Our graph-based approach offers the promise that the GECs can be “identified, enumerated, analyzed and perhaps situated within a more global map of LGT that might depict the complete spectrum of exchange relationships, from active mutual exchange communities to the underlying gossamer of one-off transformations by environmental DNA.” But the complexity of this system is deeper than this, and more subtle. As described above, LGT is a highly contingent process that ignores gene boundaries and, over time, partially overwrites its own history. The first step in our analysis must be to detect and delineate unitary regions of LGT amongst thousands of genome sequences, each millions of bases in length. Depending on the optimization decisions we take along the way – whether and when to merge nearby regions, what thresholds of statistical evidence to require, what proportions of false matches we are prepared to accept – we will identify somewhat different sets of LGT units. The consequences propagate: from different sets of units we draw different edges, generate different networks, compute different GECs, and in the case of antibiotic resistance perhaps adopt different public-health strategies. Here we propose a systematic examination of how the decisions we take in detecting and delineating units of LGT affect the systems properties that we consequently infer for the microbial biosphere and the bacterial communities therein. How robust are these systems properties to our optimization decisions? Which graphical structures represent GECs most robustly? How does our expectation about the propagation of antibiotic resistance in different regions of the microbial biosphere depend on these optimization decisions? Which specific\r\nGECs are robust to which specific decisions, and why? Our approach, tools and outcomes will be of significance not only in microbial ecology and public health, but much more broadly. Complex networks in nature, technology and society contain communities whose structure is not fixed a priori but must be discovered, delineated and optimized. Better understanding the interplay between unit of analysis and properties of networks and communities will lead to a deeper, more-integrated and more-nuanced appreciation of many complex systems.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Queensland', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020272\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '404,370', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Typically, when researchers pose this question, they tend to focus on aspects of the human mind that are computationally impressive--our capacity to learn language, use complex tools, represent causal relations, and so on. To date, scholars have gained considerable insight into the extent to which these so-called \"smart\" capacities are shared with other animals. Unfortunately, less work to date has examined the evolutionary origins of human capacities that make our species less proud. Humans are impressive in their capacity to speak and use mathematics, but we are also just as impressive in our biases and errors. Indeed, recent work in social psychology and behavioral economics has shown that human decision-making is plagued by a number of systematic errors, irrational strategies that persist in the face of time and experience. Unfortunately, little is known about the evolutionary origins of these biases. Are the systematic errors that plague human decision-making unique to our own species, the result of human-specific training and experience? Or are these errors the result of evolutionarily older processes, ones that might be shared with non-human species? The answers to these questions are critical, as understanding the origins of our human errors may provide us with helpful windows for determining ways to manage and eliminate such biases. Over the past few years, my students and I have begun a systematic study of evolution of human bias by examining the presence of similar biases in non-human primates. Recently, my students and I have developed methods that allow us to study the extent to which primates share human-like decision-making errors. Using such methods, we have learned that some non-human primate species share humanlike economic errors. Similarly, we have learned that non-human primates share the human tendency to \"rationalize\" their choices, switching their preferences to fit with their decisions. Our future work is aimed at examining the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, investigating the extent to which similar cognitive processes mediate these biases in both human and nonhuman primates. In addition, we have begun examining the evolutionary origins of other important human biases, such as our bias to favor the ingroup, stereotype others, and respond to unconscious contextual primes. As part of this future work, we hope to determine the extent to which some classic humans biases result from a long phylogenetic history, while others may be the result of human-specific cultural experiences. In doing so, we also hope to also gain insight into the best ways to allow our species to overcome their systematic biases.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Yale University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020242\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This question naturally\r\nbrings researchers to investigate the early development of cognitive functions, and theoretical positions\r\nhave coalesced around distinct alternatives. Nativists propose that infants come to the world equipped with\r\na sophisticated armament of skills and conceptual knowledge. Claims of innate specification of cognitive\r\ndomains have been bolstered by dissociations of function in individuals with developmental disorders,\r\nespecially those associated with a known genetic aetiology. Constructivist accounts instead see\r\nenvironmental input as instrumental and question the notion of developmental disorders as islets of intact\r\nand impaired ability. A way to turn impasse into dialogue is to ask how domain-specific knowledge emerges through domaingeneral\r\nprocesses such as attentional control: active selection of information in the environment gates\r\nprocessing into short-term and long-term memory. Executive processes also provide the mental workspace\r\nnecessary to select or ignore, update and maintain information online and therefore constrain domainspecific\r\nlearning both concurrently and longitudinally. Attention and executive deficits could lead to\r\ncascading effects across many domains of cognition, with uneven cognitive profiles resulting from\r\ninteractions between attentional biases and characteristics of the to-be-learned information. In this context,\r\nstudying individuals with disorders of attention and executive control from early childhood, rather than just\r\nin adulthood, has the potential to assess disorders' role in substantiating the innate specification and\r\nmodular structure of cognition. Work in my laboratory has investigated disorder-specific profiles of early attention difficulties in\r\ndevelopmental disorders that are either genetically or functionally defined, as well as their trajectories and\r\noutcomes on behaviour and cognition. Understanding how distinct attention disorders affect cognitive\r\nprocesses has required a prospective longitudinal approach and experimental paradigms that can tap\r\nattention and executive control in young and less able children. In a complementary fashion, we study\r\noptimal interactions of attention and executive control with memory and learning over typical development,\r\nfrom early childhood into adulthood. The data emerging from these studies at the interface between attention disorders and their cascading\r\neffects on cognition have generated novel questions. How do deficits influence interactions with naturalistic\r\nenvironments? Are attention deficits predetermined to follow their course, or instead malleable?

However, the growing scale and complexity of engineered systems such as the internet, the energy grid, and financial markets are straining our ability to control and predict their behavior. Engineers are increasingly facing difficulties similar to those tackled by biologists and doctors. Engineering successes have often relied on precisely predicting the behavior of individual components, so that when the components are assembled in a particular design, we can accurately predict the behavior of the full system. This approach, however, breaks down for complex systems in which individual components do not behave predictably and consistently. In large systems such as communication networks, financial markets, and the human body, similar components often exhibit different responses to identical inputs: e.g. different responses to load imbalances by substations in an energy grid, different reactions to the same financial information, and different responses to the same drug by individual cells in an organism. A grand challenge in complexity science of interest to both biologists and engineers is to determine how to study, understand, and eventually optimize distributed systems composed of parts that exhibit significant behavioral variability. In biology, cells rely on networks of biomolecules to detect, interpret, and respond to information about their environment. Cellular behaviors therefore arise from the dynamic responses of biomolecular networks. These dynamics are in turn determined by the architecture of the networks (i.e. who binds who) and by a set of dynamical parameters (e.g. gain, relaxation time, etc) that are nonlinear functions of the binding constants and relative abundances of the network components. Although selective pressures shape the genetic information that encodes for the specificity and expression levels of network components, the relative abundances of these components can be highly variable from cell-tocell due to biological noise. Sources of noise include: fluctuations in the chemical reactions underlying component synthesis and degradation; progression through the cell cycle or life cycle; local availability of metabolites; and fluctuations in environmental signals. Variability in the abundance of network components can tune a particular biological function differently for each individual cell, resulting in a distribution of network behaviors, or \"tunings,\" even throughout a genetically homogeneous population of clones. If a single optimum response exists for all situations, then behavioral variability would prevent a significant fraction of the population from performing optimally. On the other hand, if environmental conditions fluctuate in space and time, then population heterogeneity might confer robustness. Isogenic populations might use a distribution of tunings advantageously to create a diversified portfolio of specialized subpopulations while still maintaining the same network architecture. Matching the distribution of capabilities within a population to the variations of a particular environment may be crucial for survival or competitive fitness. For example, for a bacterium like , environmental parameters range from the high temperatures, low oxygen tensions, low pH, and high flow rates of mammalian guts to mostly opposite properties when living freely outside of mammals. Our current understanding of the relationship between phenotypic heterogeneity and robustness in isogenic populations comes primarily from the study of cellular systems responsible for binary decisions, in which biological noise is used to control the percentage of cells in each state. For more complex behaviors it remains unclear how phenotypic variability is controlled and what functional role it may play.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Yale University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020224\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '448,317', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The degree of recovery from aphasia represents a crucial determinant for social and vocational rehabilitation. Here, I put forward the hypothesis that understanding the organization of language networks in the healthy brain is mandatory for understanding the mechanisms underlying reorganization of language functions after focal brain damage in patients with aphasia. Identifying these mechanisms of brain repair, in turn, is essential for developing novel strategies of language rehabilitation on a neuroscience basis. Accordingly, my research program is divided into three parts. The first part is concerned with mapping the in the healthy brain using a combined approach of functional and structural neuroimaging and brain stimulation techniques. Based on the assumption that cognitive functions are instantiated through the coherent and timely interaction of anatomically connected brain regions, I am particularly interested in the (causal) functional interactions between cortical brain regions and the underlying white matter fiber tracts. Predictions made by these networks will be probed by employing temporary deactivation techniques. This will allow to test the effects of a focal lesion onto the network and to identify neural mechanisms of short-term reorganization, mimicking acute reorganization in stroke. Building upon this, the second part is dedicated to stroke patients with aphasia. The within the networks previously characterized will be tracked from acute to chronic stroke. Importantly, changes in connectivity between network constituents over time are assumed to reflect reorganization within the networks. I expect to identify prototypical patterns of reorganization depending on the lesion location. I am in particular interested in mapping the acute phase after stroke by using haemodynamic methods (i.e., functional MRI) in combination with methods independent of haemodynamic factors (i.e., EEG). This should help to shed more light on network pathologies especially in the acute phase of stroke. Information from the early phase will be used to predict language outcome and to identify neurobiological determinants of recovery. The final part aims at transferring these findings to . The impact of stimulating crucial network constituents concurrently with behavioral training on language recovery will be investigated in subacute and chronic stroke patients. Importantly, the stimulation site is guided by the findings gained from studies in healthy subjects and patients. In sum, my research program aims to bridge the gap between basic and clinically-relevant cognitive neurosciences. The findings are expected to provide an essential contribution to re-considering language as the function of large-scale brain networks.

One of the prominent developments in networks, particularly over the past decade, is the\r\nalgorithmic detection of mesoscopic structures known as communities, intuitively conceived\r\nas groups of nodes connected more tightly to each other than to the rest of the network.\r\nCommunity detection has become an excellent way to characterize and understand the mesoscopic\r\nstructures of a network.

Yet too large a mutation rate can be catastrophic, threatening the viability of lineages or even species. This has led scientists to pose the question of whether there might exist an optimal mutation rate. Drake reported similar mutation rates across a wide range of microbial genome sizes (Drake 1991 ; Drake et al. 1998), but later studies have not borne out the idea of a \"universal\" mutation rate.  Instead, research suggests that mutation rates vary not only between species, but also within species. Different mutation rates can occur in different bacterial strains; those with high mutation rates can exhibit greater antibiotic resistance, and, thus, presumably, selective advantage (Denamur and Matic 2006). Mutation rates in bacteriophage T4 (Drake et al. 1969; Schapper 1998), E. coli (Sniegowski et al. 1997; Schapper 1998) and Drosophila (Nöthel 1987) can be altered by changing external conditions. It is little wonder, then, that the variability of mutation rates, and the problem of how this variability may have changed over time, is a subject of urgent debate within the evolutionary biology community (Pigliucci 2008; Pennisi 2008). Recent papers have increasingly called for the investigation of the evolution of evolvability itself -- the tantalizingly recursive possibility that the pace of evolution is itself under evolutionary control (Bell 2005; Pigliucci 2008). Surprisingly, these issues have barely begun to be addressed from the perspective of complex systems, nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics. Several researchers have investigated the problem of optimal mutation rate from a computational perspective. Bedau and Packard (2003) developed a model in which simulated organisms (\"agents\") mutated by selecting different feeding strategy elements from a pool of possible behaviors; their fitness was found to be maximized for an intermediate mutation rate. Moreover, in competitions between agents with different mutation rates, those with intermediate, optimal mutation rates were the most successful. Bedau and Packard commented that \"the mutation rate governs a transition between two qualitatively different phases of evolutionary dynamics\", a more ordered state at low mutation rate characterized by long periods of stasis, and disordered dynamics at high mutation rates. Bedau and Packard interpreted their result as an example of adaptation to \"the edge of genetic disorder\", drawing a connection between their results and complex behavior at the boundary between two regimes in a phase transition. Approaching the problem from a different perspective, Earl and Deem (2004) investigated a model of protein evolution, where fitness was determined by minimization of an energy function. Protein evolution took place on a shifting fitness landscape determined by various properties of the environment. Earl and Deem found that larger mutational shifts dominated when the landscape shifted faster, and when shifts were of larger amplitude.  Like Bedau and Packard, Earl and Deem demonstrated the selectability of mutation rates, but rather than finding a universal optimum, their system evolved different mutation rates under different external conditions. Clune et al. (2008) explored mutation rate optimization using the Avida model, in which computer programs compete as digital organisms, and their success at performing certain computational operations serves as a measure of fitness. Again, fitness was found to be maximized at an intermediate mutation rate. Like Bedau and Packard, Clune et al. allowed their digital organisms to compete against each other. On a smooth landscape, organisms with mutation rates close to the fitness-maximizing intermediate value tended to be the survivors. On a rugged landscape, however, the surviving mutation rates were significantly lower than the optimal value. Like the Earl and Deem study, this suggests that different mutation rates may be optimal under different circumstances. Here, I propose to take a complex systems approach to investigating the role of mutations in driving evolutionary dynamics in a computational model. The work proposed here will differ from the studies cited above in two key aspects. First, I will focus on the role of maximum mutation size (here called the mutability μ) in the formation of clusters of organisms, thus linking the problem of optimal mutability to another crucial problem at the interface between complex dynamics and evolutionary biology: speciation. Secondly, I will investigate phase transition behavior as the system undergoes a transition from scattered, unclustered individuals to well-defined, structured groups, as the mutability is increased. These proposed studies will lay the necessary groundwork for my research group's long-term goal of bringing a complex systems / statistical physics approach to bear on what is perhaps the central problem of collective dynamics in evolutionary biology: the controversial problem of multiple levels of selection. In a preliminary study (Dees and Bahar 2010), we investigated the role of mutability in an agent-based model incorporating the three fundamental criteria necessary for Darwinian evolution: variability, heritability and overpopulation (Lewontin 1970). Organisms exist in a two-dimensional morphospace, with each dimension representing an arbitrary trait. At each time step, a new generation of organisms is generated, using an assortative mating algorithm (de Cara et al. 2008). The morphospace also has a third dimension, a \"fitness landscape\", represented by the color scale in Figures 1b and c, and corresponding to the number of offspring a parent will produce. Depending on the implementation of the model, the landscape may either be shifted periodically or modulated by negative feedback from the local density of organisms. Coordinates of offspring are determined as a function of the parents' coordinates, modified with a random mutation selected from a uniform distribution (or, in other simulations, from a normal distribution) and limited by the maximum mutation size, the mutability parameter μ. The model does not contain an explicit representation of genetics, and thus may be considered to lump together genetic and epigenetic effects. The choice to define the model in this way was quite deliberate; while detail is inevitably sacrificed by the absence of explicit genetics, the model has the advantage of being amenable to a rigorous comparison with mathematical models of directed percolation (see below). Clusters, the analog of species in this model, are determined by an algorithm motivated by the concept of biological species, defined as a reproductively isolated group (Mallet 1995, de Aguiar et al. 2009). Details of the clustering algorithm can be found in Dees and Bahar (2010). In all simulations, the population quickly devolved to extinction for small μ. For large μ, the system maintained a fluctuating population. For an intermediate range of values (~μcrit), a high degree of contingency was observed in the outcomes (Figure 1). Simulations over a range of μ values show that the mean population and mean number of clusters increase sharply for an intermediate range of μ values (Figure 2); clusters also become more dense and tightly packed (see Dees and Bahar 2010). These measures may be considered as order parameters characterizing the system; the large fluctuations observed around μcrit are precisely what would be expected in a critical phase transition, as is the \"contingent\" behavior illustrated in Figure 1. Another striking preliminary finding is that clustering occurs even on an entirely flat landscape, i.e., one in which every organism has identical fitness. This result is particularly intriguing in that it provides a model of speciation driven by \"drift\" alone, rather than by natural selection. The idea of speciation on a \"neutral\" landscape has been extensively debated over recent decades, most vociferously since Hubbell's generalization of neutral theory (Hubbell, 2001; Alonso et al. 2006; Leigh 2007), and is a problem of immense importance to the ecological community. A recent computational study by de Aguiar et al. (2009) demonstrated that a model incorporating assortative mating on a neutral landscape could still undergo speciation. Our result confirms that of de Aguiar, but has the advantage of being demonstrated in a model which is simpler and requires fewer assumptions. Again, this provides the advantage of accessibility to investigation from the perspective of statistical physics and complex systems theory.  Evolutionary problems have occasionally been explored by physicists in the context of self-organized criticality and complex systems theory; Bedau and Packard (2003) refer to this issue in their discussion of a transition to the \"edge of disorder\". One of the most oft-cited examples of an attempt to place evolutionary dynamics in the context of the physics of criticality is the \"sandpile\" model of punctuated equilibrium developed by Sneppen and Bak, in which bursts of extinction in simulated species follow punctuated, scale-free, power-law behavior (Bak and Sneppen 1993; Sneppen et al. 1995). The present model, however, is particularly unique and powerful in that it allows the investigation of critical scaling and phase transition behavior in the context of a model of speciation -- in other words, a model for the crystallizing of one evolutionary scale (individuals) into another (species).", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Missouri - St. Louis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020276\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '188,214', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The words and sentences we choose are important for imparting our ideas, beliefs, commands, and opinions to others. Language is typically studied in terms of the words and sentences we choose; however, there are other aspects of language that are at least as important, but rarely studied. These fall into the category of not we say but we say it. For example, a sentence like “John called Frank an intellectual, and then he insulted him” has a very different meaning than “John called Frank an intellectual and then HE insulted HIM.” In the latter case, being an intellectual is an insult. In the former case, it is not. Note that in both examples, the word choice and the sentence structure are the same, but how they are said drastically affects interpretation. This aspect of language is called prosody. It includes the stress, pitch, rhythm, and intonation of language. Although communication is possible when prosody is absent, as in email or in texts, communication is more challenging. A brief response in an email might be interpreted as curtness rather than the result of the author being in a hurry. An ironic response in a text message might sound like biting sarcasm without the accompanying prosodic information. Despite its importance, we know very little about the structure of prosody, the cognitive processes that are deployed in constructing it, or how it is interpreted. Understanding prosody is critical for building speech systems, designing interventions for individuals with communication disorders, and in developing pedagogical strategies for people learning English as a second language. A psychological theory of prosody could also answer a very basic question about communication: What makes certain ways of speaking more effective than others for listeners? Over the past several years, my research program has focused on developing theories of prosody as a way to better understand the cognitive mechanisms that underlie language use, and cognition more generally. One of the things that we have learned is that prosodic choices are sometimes the byproduct of speech production mechanisms, but they can also stem from decisions to assist listeners in comprehension. Much of the information conveyed by prosody is about the structure, organization, and attitudes of the speaker towards the information that is being conveyed. By understanding how prosody organizes linguistic information for the listener, we can better understand the underlying architecture of the language comprehension system and also gain insight into the mechanisms that underlie language production.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020287\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

For centuries, volition has been subject to religious and philosophical enquiry. Nowadays, most would agree that volition is closely connected with the brain. However, a neuroscientific understanding of voluntary action must include a mechanism for behavioural choices, and include the sense that we cause our actions (called agency), drawing on psychology and computational biology. Clinical disorders of volition studied alongside healthy cognition can greatly illuminate the mechanisms involved. This program will consider one disease in particular, the Pick’s Disease Complex (PDC), as it causes several distinct problems with voluntary action. There are three key challenges to this research. The first is that volition is not absolute, as described in the traditional dichotomy between free will and determinism, but variable. Actions may be impossible (e.g. I cannot fly), weighted by differences in outcome (e.g.do I select the rotten or the ripe apple?) or equivalent (e.g. which of two identical buttons should I press?). There is therefore a spectrum of possible acts with variable degrees of volition, which needs to be understood and formalised. The second challenge is to develop a neurocognitive model of volition without an implicit homunculus. Some models attribute agency to higher order neurocognitive processes (as an implied homunculus) but do not address fundamentally how voluntary decisions arise. We will instead use biologically motivated neural accumulator models to study key features of voluntary action. For example, when given a series of free choices, why can healthy people not choose at random? How are current choices so strongly influenced by previous actions? We will also address the profound lack of volition in PDC, developing a model of apathy based on dissipation of decision information by ‘leaky’ accumulators. The third challenge we call epistemological opacity: that is, people cannot simply tell us what was happening at the moment of voluntary action. Experiment, not introspection, is required. Although one cannot measure agency directly, we will examine ‘behavioural signatures’ of agency including intentional binding (in which agency creates the perception that actions and outcomes are closely bound together in time) in PDC, and intentional priors (which distort the perceived outcomes of our own actions). The approach makes several key problems of volition and agency tractable for scientific enquiry. The aim is to increase our understanding of this important aspect of normal human cognition. The subject is not only of interest to psychologists, but many academic disciplines, with potentially far-reaching effects ranging from optimising social and economic decisions to accelerating motor skills training.

My research investigates how children acquire the logical representations that underlie language, and thus how they learn abstract, uniquely human, concepts. A guiding hypothesis of this work is that many important conceptual changes in human development do not require the creation of entirely novel representations, but instead emerge from the representational resources provided by natural language. My research asks how children learn words and structures that are inherently abstract. Although many words that children learn early in development refer to kinds of objects and events in the world (e.g., , ), they also must learn words like , , and , which don’t refer to objects, or even to their properties. Instead, these words refer to the properties of sets. For example, in a group of five rabbits, no individual animal has the property of “fiveness”. Further, many different types of sets can be described by , including people, places, events, and ideas. These words, and other logical expressions in language, pose a special problem to children, and offer a unique window into the origin of human knowledge. By studying how children acquire abstract words, my research program engages three fundamental problems that confront psychology. The first problem is how we can explain the acquisition of concepts that do not transparently reflect properties of the physical world. What are the first assumptions that children make about such words when they hear them in language, and what kinds of evidence do they use to decode their meanings? Second, I am interested in how linguistic structure affects learning, and whether grammatical differences between languages cause differences in conceptual development. Are there concepts that are easier to learn in some languages than in others? Or do cross-linguistic differences have little effect on the rate at which concepts emerge in development? Finally, my research asks whether linguistic variation across cultures results in different ways of perceiving and reasoning about the world in adult language users. Do speakers perceive the world differently depending on the words provided by their language? Or do words merely express concepts that are available to all humans, regardless of cross-linguistic differences? My plan for the coming years is to explore the relationship between linguistic structure and conceptual development by tackling problems ranging from how children learn the meanings of abstract words, to how they learn to count and do mathematical computations. To determine the contributions of cultural and linguistic diversity on conceptual development, the research will be conducted across a diverse range of sites including the US, Japan, Taiwan, India, and Mexico.

GBMs have an incidence of ~3/100,000 per year and often occur in patients of >50 years of age. However, they are an important cause of cancer-related deaths in younger adults. Cure rates for GBMs are below 5%. These tumors cannot be routinely removed entirely by surgery as their invasive nature precludes the extirpation of all cells without massive brain damage. Since GBMs harbor cancer stem cells with enhanced DNA repair programs, that render them more resistant to radiation and conventional chemotherapy, leaving behind even a few of them after surgery poses the problem of recurrence and eventual patient death (Singh et al., 2003; Bao et al., 2006; Furnari et al., 2007). Developing an effective GBM therapy represents a great challenge. For instance, targeting mutant deltaEGFR, one of the major GBM oncogenes, leads to tumor escape through gain of an alternative mechanism (e.g. Mukasa et al., 2010). New possibilities for GBM therapies derive from the study of stem cells. Cancer stem cells are defined as cells that can self-renew and give rise to more differentiated progeny, much like normal stem cells, but unlike these, cancer stem cells can induce tumor growth as assayed in immunodeficient mice (reviewed Reya et al., 2001; Ruiz i Altaba and Brand, 2009). Understanding the factors that regulate cancer stem cell self-renewal will likely shed light on novel ways to attack and kill these cells that maintain the growing GBMs and may induce recurrence. Our goal is to induce GBM stem cell death or differentiation and thus tumor regression and disappearance. The state of a cell is plastic. Many types of normal differentiated cells have been shown to be directly reprogrammable to embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like (iPS) cells through the transient expression of a limited cohort of genes (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006; Yu et al., 2007; Wernig et al., 2007). The original reprogramming gene cohort comprises Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, Klf4 (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006) but variants include, directly (Yu et al., 2007) or indirectly, the action of the ESC transcription factor Nanog (Chambers et al., 2003; Mitsui et al. 2003). Reprogramming functions act in a network so that activation of a few nodes (e.g. Oct4, Nanog) leads to the activation of the network that drives a drastic change in fate. Depending on the functions already present in the target cells, reprogramming may occur with very few alterations. For example, neural stem cells have been reported to be reprogrammable to iPS cells with only 1 factor (Oct4; Kim et al., 2009). Cancer stem cells appear not to be an exception; for example, malignant human melanoma cells can be induced to become normal neural crest cells when introduced into the dorsal mid/hindbrain of chick embryos, a place where neural crest cells normally develop (reviewed in Hendrix et al., 2007). These findings suggest that the state of cancer cells is not fixed and that once we identify and manipulate the right regulators we will be able to induce their death, permanent arrest, or loss of malignancy through differentiation. One key question is thus the nature and function of such genes that characterize and maintain GBM stem cells. One possibility is that reprogramming genes are involved in cancer stemness. This is an exciting idea and different recent lines of evidence from our and other laboratories support this possibility in GBMs. Our interest in GBMs allowed us to show for the first time that GBM cancer stem cells require SONIC HEDGEHOG (SHH)-GLI signaling for growth, proliferation and survival (Dahmane et al., 2001; Clement et al., 2007; Zbinden et al., 2010). Additional studies provided further support for our findings (e.g. Bar et al., 2007; Ehtesham et al., 2007) and suggest that GLI1 may be a prognostic marker for GBM (Rossi et al., 2011). SHH-GLI signaling is a key intercellular communication pathway that we and others have shown also participates in the control of normal neural stem cell and brain precursor behavior (e.g. Dahmane and Ruiz i Altaba, 1999; Dahmane et al., 2001; Lai et al., 2003; Palma and Ruiz i Altaba, 2004). Thus these data raised the possibility that SHH-GLI signaling is an essential signaling pathway involved in the maintenance of both normal brain stem cells and of GBM stem cells. We also originally found that GBMs and lower grade gliomas express a core ESC-like signature that includes the expression of a number of genes previously involved in regulating ESCs and reprogramming that include NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 (Clement et al., 2007). Later on such a signature was also detected in other cancer types (Ben-Porath et al., 2008). Upon blockade of SHH-GLI signaling, the levels of this ESC-like signature (including those of the key stemness gene NANOG), GBM growth, and the number of GBM stem cells drastically decreased (Clement et al., 2007), suggesting a connection between GBM stem cells and SHH-GLI signaling, and thus beginning to highlight the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM stemness. Other evidence for a link derives from parallel studies we have carried out on the role of GLI1, the downstream effector of SHH signaling and a key node in signaling integration (e.g. Lee et al., 1997; Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2010). Enhanced GLI1 function in the brain of transgenic mice drives increased neural stem cell self-renewal, brain overgrowth and much increased levels of Nanog (Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2009). GLI1 not only imparted normal stem cells/early precursors with enhanced stem cell properties but also with increased invasiveness of the brain parenchyma (Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2009). GLI1 thus appeared as a bona fide GBM stem cell regulator that we ought to target. However, it remained unclear if the genes - composing the ESC-like signature in gliomas that is regulated by SHH-GLI - are functional and drive GBM stemness and thus tumor persistence and growth. To address this question we decided to directly test the function of the key pluripotency homeodomain protein NANOG in human GBM, using primary tumors implanted into the brain of immunodeficient mice (orthotopic xenografts). Our very recent work shows for the first time that NANOG is essential for GBM growth in vivo. Its knockdown with lentivector-encoded shRNAs (against NANOG and NANOGP8 thus targeting the two NANOG-producing genes) abolished the growth of cell line and primary GBMs (Zbinden et al., 2010). In other words, NANOG function is absolutely essential for GBM growth in mice, suggesting a similar requirement in patients. Mechanistically, we showed that NANOG is an essential downstream mediator of HH-GLI signaling in gliomas, forming a positive regulatory loop with GLI1. In contrast, and like GLI1 (Stecca and Ruiz i Altaba, 2009; see also Abe et al., 2008), it acts in a negative loop with p53, which is often lost in GBMs (Furnari et al., 2007). A GLI1-NANOG module is thus an essential node in the control human GBM stemness and tumor growth (Zbinden et al., 2010). Our data open exciting possibilities for therapeutic intervention against human GBMs. For the first time we have provided the proof of principle that blocking the function of NANOG, a single key stemness factor in primary human GBMs, is sufficient to repress GLI1 and to prevent tumor growth in vivo (Zbinden et al., 2010). Since endogenous normal NANOG function may be restricted to the embryonic brain and adult stem cell niches (e.g. Po et al., 2010), we reasoned that inhibiting its function over a defined period of time should obliterate GBMs and prevent recurrence while allowing normal recovery of endogenous stem cell lineages, possibly recapitulating our previous findings in colon cancers and melanomas with time-limited SHH-GLI inhibition (Stecca et al., 2007; Varnat et al., 2009). In this project we propose to develop innovative NANOG repressors able to penetrate tumor cells in vivo, with the aim to kill GBM stem cells and thus the tumor itself and any and all recurrences. Our strategy should also allow for the destruction of invasive stem cells that are impossible to target otherwise.

Ecologists seek to predict why one species lives in this patch and not another. A century of research in community ecology has revealed few generalities. In many cases, one species dominates one patch but not another one even though the patches share the same environmental conditions. This failure of prediction has led some to speculate that ecology alone cannot explain natural species distributions (1). Where does community ecology go from here? I suggest that a community ecology informed by evolutionary biology will explain the high levels of context dependency observed in diversity patterns. Here I propose manipulative experiments to parameterize and inform emerging theory that lies at the interface of complex adaptive systems research in evolution and ecology. Historically, ecologists have assumed that evolution occurred too slowly to influence ecological dynamics. This assumption has produced a longstanding gap between evolutionary and ecological thought (2). Yet, evidence increasingly suggests that populations often evolve rapidly in response to strong selection and in concert with ecological dynamics (3-6). Moreover, evolutionary dynamics can interact with ecological dynamics to produce outcomes that cannot be predicted based on each dynamic alone (6,7). Future research that links emerging theory with experiments is necessary to test rapidly developing theoretical predictions and to usher in new community ecology theories originating from the first principles of evolutionary biology (8). My colleagues and I recently developed a theoretical framework to understand how evolution influences multiple communities that occur together in a regional landscape -- the so-called evolving metacommunity framework (7,9,10). A metacommunity is a set of biological communities for which migration integrates local dynamics across the larger region to produce emergent effects (11). This ecological concept, however, neglects the potential for evolutionary dynamics. In the same metacommunity, populations can adapt to local conditions as mediated by regional migration (10). The evolving metacommunity combines these two dynamics: populations adapt to local interactions, and migration shapes both ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Metacommunity ecology and metapopulation genetics each individually fulfill the four properties of a complex adaptive system delineated by Holland (12) and clarified for biological systems by Levin (13). Hence, the evolving metacommunity is a doubly complex adaptive system that determines global and regional distributions of genetic and species diversity. The monopolization effect has emerged as one of the most important and novel predictions from the evolving metacommunity framework (14,15). A monopolization effect occurs when community assembly depends on a race between local adaptation in the initial colonizing species and the arrival of another species. To illustrate this dynamic, first imagine a new patch generated by a disturbance. The first species to arrive is poorly adapted to local conditions. Other better adapted competing species exist in the metacommunity, but have not yet arrived. If these competitors arrive quickly, then they will outcompete and replace this initial colonist. In this case, the initial traits of the colonizing species will predict the community dynamics as is commonly assumed in traditional community ecology. But now consider what happens if the initial colonist adapts for several generations before the competitor arrives. This local adaptation allows the initial colonist to monopolize available resources and prevent other competing species from colonizing or reaching high abundances. Early colonization and local adaptation now determine community dynamics rather than each species' initial traits because evolution alters these traits. Community assembly thus depends on the outcome of a race between local adaptation and the immigration of pre-adapted species. The monopolization effect is a new concept in community ecology. Underlying theory has developed in the last three years (7,15,16). We recently showed that monopolization effects can occur under a wide parameter range even if the original colonist only has a few generations to adapt before another colonist arrives (16). We have since expanded this theory to include multiple patches and multiple pre-adapted species in a metacommunity. Even in this conservative case, we observe monopolization effects as long as migration rate is moderate and genetic variation exists to fuel an adaptive response. Monopolization effects thus offer a potentially general mechanism underlying community assembly dynamics that could explain the high levels of context-dependency observed in natural communities. Monopolization effects also could inform other universal questions such as why sexual reproduction repeatedly evolves despite the demographic cost of producing non-fertile males. Theory on monopolization effects suggests that sexual organisms should originate in regions with high patch disturbance rates because they can re-combine genes to adapt quickly to newly colonized patches. Hence, understanding monopolization effects will reveal if evolution introduces context-dependency into patterns of biological diversity and will contribute to our understanding of the value of sex. Despite its broad potential relevance to understanding community dynamics and species distributions, the monopolization effect has not been tested empirically in realistically complex systems. Therefore, further theoretical developments await insights from tests of existing theory. Here I propose to test multiple predictions in a tractable community of small crustaceans, which play key roles in mediating dynamics between aquatic plants and top predators in lake communities. These species are also conducive to experimental evolution because they have rapid generation lengths. I will focus on the water flea Daphnia pulex, which has become a model organism for both ecological and evolutionary studies (17) and which can be studied under laboratory, semi-natural, and natural field conditions. I propose experiments to test for monopolization effects in carefully controlled laboratory conditions and in more realistic and complex communities formed in arrays of large outdoor mesocosms. The goal of these experiments is to test existing theoretical predictions and then use insights derived in real systems to inform the further development of this emerging body of theory. In each experiment, I will manipulate the important variables determined from theoretical models thus far: migration rate, pre-adaptation to the novel environment, genetic variance, and sexual or asexual reproduction. I will first establish colonies of D. pulex clones as well as their natural competitor, the water flea Ceriodaphnia reticulata (18), collected from natural ponds. I will then raise clones of both species in each of three temperatures to select for thermal adaptations to each environment. Therefore, I can directly control the genetic variance in the D. pulex colonizing population by altering the number of clones and their laboratory population of origin. I can also manipulate incidence of sex because some D. pulex clones are obligately parthenogenetic (19), allowing contrasts between evolution limited to new mutations versus evolution aided by new genetic variance through sexual recombination. In the laboratory experiment, I will first introduce D. pulex to a novel hot environment. Then I will introduce C. reticulata at varying time points to simulate different colonization intervals between D. pulex and C. reticulata. I will also vary D. pulex genetic variation and C. reticulata pre-adaptation factorially. Lastly I will use asexual and sexual D. pulex clones to test the value of sex in facilitating rapid adaptation to novel habitats. I will then expand upon laboratory experiments and conduct experiments in outdoor arrays of 1000-L mesocosms that simulate more realistic aquatic communities. I will create spatial arrays of paired ambient and heated \"ponds\" at varying distances from source populations of the two species, each adapted to either of the environments. Ponds will be colonized both by source populations of laboratory cultures and natural colonists. By varying distances between target and source ponds, I can test for an effect of inter-patch migration on monopolization effects. If monopolization effects occur, then some ponds will be dominated by the species initially maladapted to that environment. Species and genetic diversities depend on analogous processes -- the locally homogenizing effect of environmental selection and the disruptive effect of inter-patch migration. Yet these two complex adaptive systems have seldom been united owing to artificial disciplinary boundaries kept in place by independent funding opportunities, journal foci, and departmental distinctions (2,20). Whenever we explore regions of overlap, we discover novel emergent dynamics not predicted by ecology and evolution alone (6). One of these novel dynamics occurs through the monopolization effect. I propose to test if monopolization effects can explain the context-dependency often observed in community ecology. Results will provide the necessary feedback between model and reality to inform the next generation of community ecology theories. If monopolization effects are common as suggested by new theory (16), then results will lead us to a more integrated and accurate community ecology. Monopolization effects have profound implications not only for basic science, but also for applied science, such as predicting how evolution will affect community responses to climate change, counteracting the spread of diverse agricultural pests, and understanding the dynamics between multiple disease agents and the human body.

Central to this information processing are transcriptional regulatory networks that control what  genes are expressed and when.  A  fundamental question in understanding living systems is how regulatory networks drive  the  overall  ability of organisms  to respond  and adapt  to different  environmental conditions.  Two major directions of research have been undertaken  towards addressing this question. The first direction focuses  on  what the networks are in a cell. Because  most regulatory networks are not known, the ability to accurately reconstruct these networks is  one of the major challenges in systems biology.   The second direction asks  what properties  make  networks robust and adaptable to external perturbations.  Although  both directions of  research  have contributed to our  understanding of  regulatory networks, we lack an integrated  picture of  the relationship between regulatory network changes to overall organism state.  This is  largely because these directions of research have been pursued independently. In particular, a  large number of data-driven “network reconstruction” methods have been developed that aim to  infer the unknown regulatory network from genome-wide gene expression measurements. Unfortunately,  the networks inferred from these methods typically do not correspond  to physical  regulatory interactions between regulatory proteins and target genes.  On the other hand,  most  studies of network robustness have used physical regulatory networks available in a model  organism (e.g. yeast) or have used  simulated networks. Because inferred networks have not  been rigorously examined  for robustness and  evolvability, we currently do not know whether the  networks that we learn from observational data do exhibit such properties or  whether  the  inferred networks only reflect statistical correlations that do not have any mechanistic  underpinnings in the cell. In particular, it is possible that there are many “equally likely or good”  networks that could perform the same function and  the expression  data are inferring a different  network than what is being measured  using other experiments. To understand how regulatory networks contribute to and determine overall organism function  we turn to evolution.  Evolution is the ultimate tinkerer of living systems. Therefore, examining how regulatory networks have evolved to their current day configurations in extant species  and  predicting changes in phenotypes from changes to network components, we can obtain a more  complete understanding of how networks drive  complex functions.   However, this requires us to  first, accurately  infer regulatory networks and second, to examine how changes in regulatory  networks drive overall organismal  state  change. We will use a probabilistic graphical model  representation of regulatory networks  to tackle these questions.  We will develop methods  to  learn data-driven regulatory networks that exhibit topological properties of robustness.  Our  approach  will impose structural constraints on the graph structure that have been associated  with robust networks.  Next we will develop a probabilistic framework of network evolution  to detect  selection on network components (e.g. network motifs).  Our evolutionary approach  will  be developed and tested in collaboration  to study three biological processes: stress response in  yeast, tissue-specific expression in  vertebrate species, and plant-microbe symbiotic interactions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Wisconsin - Madison', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020473\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Behavioral constructs representing executive  control, speed of processing, and long-term memory begin to  decline  as early as the  third decade of  life,  whereas ability in  other  constructs representing verbal aptitude and  world knowledge  can exhibit maintenance and in some cases increases throughout  later  adulthood. These cognitive  abilities are mediated by information processing across  distributed  brain areas  that interact in a large-scale brain network.  Accordingly, many  influential ideas in aging research have often  directly or indirectly invoked metaphors  referring to networks  to characterize and explain age-related brain and behavioral  changes  (e.g.,  ‘scaffolds’,  ‘reserve’,  ‘efficiency’,  ‘disconnection’,  ‘dis-integration’).  Despite  the intuitive appeal  of thinking about age-related changes  as a process of  changes in the brain network, the absence of a  formal framework for studying aging  networks has prohibited deep exploration of  age-related cognitive decline  (and  maintenance)  from a  network-based  systems neuroscience perspective. A number of observations suggest that  aging  brain networks may share features  comparable to other real-world networks that make them simultaneously efficient but  also vulnerable to sudden, ostensibly unpredictable events that  can  render  the network  disabled. For example,  healthy  aging is accompanied by progressive anatomical and  functional degradation. While some of these changes mirror changes in cognitive ability,  it is clear that some individuals are able to tolerate seemingly comparable burden more  gracefully than others.  Do the progressive changes that accompany  healthy  aging  result  in  subtle changes in brain network  organization? If so,  might those individuals that are  able to harbor greater age-related degeneration exhibit greater  fault  tolerance  in their brain  networks?  Conversely,  might sudden cognitive decline that  seems to inflict some  individuals  be best understood in terms of a ‘tipping-point’  that follows  continuous network insult? The goal of my research program is to develop and apply a formal  network-analysis approach  towards studying the  healthy  aging brain  and  its changing  cognitive abilities.  This  goal relies on the application of mathematical approaches such as graph theory to  measurements of brain connectivity derived from functional brain imaging (both at rest  and during task performance). Combining observations from single individuals scanned  across multiple time points (longitudinal data) with observations from  large groups of  individuals spanning  the adult lifespan (cross-sectional data), we will  describe the  changes  in  areal brain network organization across the healthy adult lifespan. This  information will be  integrated with additional  imaging-based  brain measurements (e.g.,  grey matter thickness, white matter integrity, amyloid- and tau-protein  deposition) to  understand the impact of  focal  changes in measurements of brain  integrity to  changes in  network organization, and their joint relationship to changes in  cognitive  ability.  As a  final  objective for this  program of research, the network-framework of aging will be used  to  guide  initial studies aimed at understanding age-related changes in information  processing. By  thoroughly characterizing age related brain-network and cognitive  change in health, we hope to  take initial steps towards creating  well-described  points of  reference for  understanding age-related disease.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020468\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

What  drives this human brain uniqueness? This has been a question  that has fascinated us for some time. However, this strong curiosity and an abundance of research have yet to  yield more than only a few insights into the biological underpinnings  of  human brain specializations. The focus of  my  research is to identify the genes and molecular pathways that have uniquely evolved along the  human lineage, and functionally understand the roles of these genes and pathways in human  cognition. This  approach provides an opportunity to understand human cognition at the genomic level. This analytical strategy, “cognitive genomics”,  is ripe to deliver novel insights into human brain function.  One of the  long-lasting impacts of understanding evolved human cognition at a molecular level should  be to facilitate breakthroughs that  ameliorate disorders of cognition such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia,  or autism.  My research program  is predicated on the  hypothesis that vulnerability to  cognitive disorders emerged as  a consequence of the  evolution of cognition itself.   Therefore, we  will understand these disorders  by studying  human  brain evolution  and  vice versa. While the human brain and the genetic networks that underlie the brain and its function are comprised of  seemingly infinitely complex systems, a comparative  species  approach can deftly identify  key factors that might  drive  evolved  human cognition.  This is because while humans have genetically similar building blocks to non-human primates in the form of genes,  the  identification of the  combinatorial and regulatory network of these  genes  may provide insights into different organismal  specializations and  cognitive behaviors. My research has  found that by taking a holistic and unbiased gene network approach that is akin to topological networks found  in nature, complex gene expression patterns can be parsed into digestible units  to identify functional  underpinnings.  For example, brain  gene expression phylogeny is highly similar to known species phylogeny.  However,  my work has  found evidence for accelerated evolution of gene  coexpression or  connectivity, and  hence gene regulation, in the human brain. The functional consequences of this  human modified brain  network  connectivity could impact a number of systems from  cell type specification, synaptic development, intracellular  signaling pathways, and/or neuronal activity, all of which would ultimately affect cognitive function. With support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation,  I propose to use comparative genomics and  coexpression networks to  address the question:  what makes  human  cognition unique at the molecular level? I further propose to  determine the functional significance of this evolved  genomic  connectivity.  Human gene  expression patterns will be  identified by  comparing humans  to other closely related species.  These human  brain expression  patterns will be  related to functional measurements of human  brain activity (e.g.  fMRI and  EEG).  Salient genes identified will be functionally characterized to further delineate the  molecular mechanisms  of  unique human cognition.  This proposed  research program should advance our understanding of how to  connect  human  cognition to evolved molecular mechanisms at the level  of genomic networks.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020467\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Increases in temperature, relocation of species, and shifts in predation  risk  are altering the ecology of communities around the globe. A significant part of  these  shifts is  linked to  changes in body size. Despite a long appreciation for the relevance of body size in  ecology,  we have not developed the understanding needed to explain past changes or predict  future changes in size, nor can we predict the consequences of body size evolution on  ecological communities and the services these communities provide. My current research program has focused on  developing three approaches that together can  foster a holistic understanding of body size evolution and  its  effect on ecological communities. These approaches include:  1)  building exhaustive databases on body size-dependent  processes that are central to ecological interactions,  2)  deriving a mechanistic optimality model  for the evolution of body size (i.e., the Supply-Demand [SD] model), and 3)  developing a new  class of eco-evolutionary model that enables rapid evolution to arise naturally from the fitness  landscape generated by ecological processes. The models from the third approach, called  Gillespie eco-evolutionary models (GEMs), can connect traits such as body size to any  ecological process, allowing us to predict the direction of trait evolution and the feedback of that  evolution on ecological dynamics. In this essay, I describe  my goal of bringing these three approaches together to build SD-GEMs.  These models will  allow us to resolve the problem of how body size evolution may mediate the  effects of environmental change on ecological communities. Importantly,  SD-GEMs  contribute to  complex systems science by  1)  linking individual-level  processes (fitness, traits) to species  interactions (predation, competition) and community-level patterns (dynamics, species  persistence, diversity) and  2) enabling many  (or all) ecological  interactions to simultaneously  influence the evolution of traits.  With  this new  complex systems  approach, we can attempt to  understand how and when body size should evolve and what happens to the  parts and  the  whole ecological  system as a result. Two examples illustrate the  broad  applicability of  the SD-GEM approach.  First, invasive  predators  – many of which are getting larger  as time progresses  – are disrupting food webs  around the world. SD-GEMs can help us understand how invaded systems  may change and  predict the course of body  size evolution for the invader or the surviving native prey.  Second,  the practice of  biocontrol uses predators to control insect pests, and such predators have size-dependent links with their prey.  SD-GEMs will help us understand how the introduction of  natural enemies influences body size evolution of the predator or the target pest and  help us  predict how well the biocontrol approach  should work through time. In both of the above scenarios, not accounting for both the size-dependence of processes and  the evolution of body size will severely limit our ability to forecast ecological change. SD-GEMs  are uniquely positioned to predict the  ecological  changes that may unfold as body size  evolves  in  response to environmental change.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Nebraska - Lincoln', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020471', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This\ntheory of linguistic relativity, most notably articulated in the hypothesis, has\ngenerated rich debate about the relationship between language and thought. My research\nprogram sharpens this debate by asking whether language in any form supports uniquely human\nabilities to reason about the world. Moreover, I consider whether the relationship between\nlanguage and cognition can be mediated by the modality of one's language: signed or spoken. With support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation I will aim to pinpoint the exact\nnature of the relationship between language and cognition by combining laboratory research and\nfieldwork to investigate (a) aspects of human cognition that depend on having a language- any\nlanguage, (b) effects of language modality, spoken or signed, on cognition, and (c) effects of\ncognition on the acquisition and emergence of language in the visual-spatial modality. Because\nexperimental deprivation of language to children is unethical, I work with populations where we\nobserve naturally occurring manipulations of language exposure: deaf children with delayed\nfirst-language exposure, learners of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua, and children and\nadults who acquired a sign language from birth. Each allows us to ethically isolate differential\neffects of language on cognition, and of cognition on language. Within each of the three directions, I examine the same three areas: theory-of-mind,\nspatial cognition, and analogical reasoning.

In the domain of spatial cognition, my work investigates the ability\nto integrate multiple cues for navigation, engage in visual perspective-taking, and categorize the\nway in which objects are spatially located. With respect to analogical reasoning, I focus on the\nability to detect and generate analogical mappings between a meaning (e.g., a location) and\neither a linguistic (e.g., a word) or non-linguistic (e.g., a map) representation. By identifying the domains of human cognition that depend on language and vice versa,\nwe gain deep insight into how language and cognition leveraged elements from each other over\nthe course of evolution to engender modern human cognition.

Impairments can be highly selective, as in prosopagnosia,\nwhere individuals have disproportionate difficulty recognizing faces. Category-specific\nimpairments raise intriguing questions about how information is processed and stored in the\nbrain: How do brain regions become specialized for particular categories? How malleable are\ncategorization processes and boundaries? What are the cortical dynamics of factors that influence\ncategorization? Brain imaging studies in neurologically typical individuals indicate rich categorical structure\nincluding specialization for faces, body parts, tools, and words. Although these data suggest that\ncategory representations are stable and discrete, other studies show evidence of neural plasticity\nwith the acquisition of perceptual expertise (the ability to rapidly identify objects within a\nhomogeneous category). My theoretical approach conceptualizes category specificity as an\nemergent property of a dynamic representational system that is widely distributed and\noverlapping. My approach offers an alternative framework to domain-specific accounts and\npushes my research beyond defining category boundaries . My\nresearch program uses both behavior and electrophysiology to investigate how factors such as\nexperience, context, and task demands interact with object properties and brain processing biases\nto produce a variety of category-specific effects.

How do newborns transform streams of sensory input into knowledge? What mechanisms underlie newborn perception and cognition? Despite widespread interest in these questions, two methodological barriers have hindered progress. First, it is not possible to conduct controlled-rearing studies on newborn humans, so researchers could not perform causal tests of how specific experiences shape the newborn mind. Second, newborn humans cannot be tested for long periods of time, limiting our ability to study newborn cognitive development with high precision. To overcome these barriers, my lab developed an automated controlled-rearing method with a newborn animal model: the domestic chick. This method allows us to study newborn subjects continuously (24/7) within strictly controlled virtual environments. By recording each subject’s behavior continuously, we can achieve low measurement error and obtain large, robust effects across experiments. With massive amounts of data from each subject, we can also examine whether each newborn succeeded or failed at an experimental task and study individual differences across newborn subjects. My lab is currently using automated controlled rearing to study how object recognition emerges in newborn brains. With new funding support, we will extend this approach to other domains, including face recognition, action perception, naïve physics, and numerical cognition. To understand the development of these abilities, we will focus on three interconnected components of newborn minds: In parallel to the controlled-rearing experiments, my lab will build artificial newborn agents. These agents will learn about the world autonomously, using a combination of information seeking, sensory processing, and reinforcement learning systems. To measure the learning abilities of the agents, we will construct virtual worlds that simulate our controlled-rearing experiments. We will then test whether the artificial agents learn about the worlds in the same way as the newborn subjects tested in our controlled-rearing experiments. Ultimately, a central goal of my lab is to build a pixels-to-actions artificial agent that learns about the world like a newborn. Building an artificial agent that learns like a newborn would represent an effective measure of success in terms of understanding cognitive development and be a major achievement for the field. More generally, this two-pronged approach—linking controlled rearing to artificial intelligence—provides a unified framework for studying newborn minds. To promote the transparency, reproducibility, and replicability of controlled-rearing research, my lab will construct an open-source repository containing all of the stimuli and data from our experiments. This repository will be a valuable resource for comparing the learning abilities of newborn animals and artificial agents. Our goal is to make our input-output maps widely available to the scientific community and foster interactions between developmental science, computational neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Southern California', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020508', 'year': '2017', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Since 1990 forest cover has been\r\nreduced by an area larger than France—roughly 0.5% of global land area—and the\r\nMillenium Ecosystem Assessment reports predictions of future declines, mainly in the\r\ndeveloping world. Other terrestrial ecosystems, such as natural grasslands, face similar,\r\nif not greater, levels of endangerment because, while pressures from human activity\r\nalso persist, they have generally received less attention in the past from conservation\r\nmovements. To exacerbate this condition, grasslands, as opposed to forests, may be less\r\nfavoured by future climatic change, as in the past forests have expanded over\r\ngrasslands when climate conditions became favourable. Much, if not all, of the human-dominated landscapes of our world, and indeed, several\r\nnaturally occurring landscapes, are mosaic ecosystems. These are landscapes that\r\nexhibit complex spatial patterns of heterogeneity, in which, for terrestrial systems,\r\npatches can represent forest stands, grasslands, farms or even urban areas. Complex\r\nsystems science suggests that certain mosaic ecosystems can exhibit alternative stables\r\nstates, whereby for the same environmental parameters the ecosystem could equally\r\nwell reside either in one state or another state depending on the initial conditions of the\r\nsystem. These are stable states over ecologically relevant timescales that are resilient to\r\nsmall perturbations. However, the shift from one state to another can occur due to a\r\nthreshold response and thus the dynamics of such systems is not continuous but can\r\nlead to surprises for the observer, unless the underlying dynamics is fully understood. Naturally occurring forest-grassland mosaics exemplify this phenomenon of alternate\r\nstable states. Because mosaic ecosystems with alternative stable states can be readily\r\n‘flipped’ from one state to another, an understanding of the basic biophysical\r\nmechanisms involved is important. However, perhaps of greater significance is the fact\r\nthat the potential human impact on these ecosystems is large. Despite this, the impact of\r\nchanges in mosaic ecosystem states on human perceptions of conservation priorities,\r\nand the resulting feedback of changing human activities back onto mosaic ecosystem\r\ndynamics (coupled human-environment dynamics), has rarely been investigated. Our objective is thus to generate models of complex forest-grassland mosaic\r\necosystems based on southern Brazilian and Indian examples where models of human\r\nbehaviour (including strategic interactions) are coupled with ecological dynamics. We\r\nwill attempt to parameterize the human models with data from surveys that we will\r\nadminister in our regions of study. These models will help understand and ultimately\r\nenhance terrestrial ecosystem sustainability. Though our models will focus on two case studies, the general framework of our approach should motivate work in other kinds of\r\nhuman-influenced mosaic ecosystems, not just those involving forests and grasslands,\r\nbut perhaps those involving forests and increasingly important mosaic components such\r\nas agricultural land. Related work in coupled human-mosaic marine and other aquatic\r\necosystems could also find cross-fertilization with our research.

Complex systems are recognisable through their behaviours and their architecture. They often respond nonlinearly (disproportionately) to small perturbations; they process information; they self-organize and adapt to their local environment, often via the action of selection on diversity; they incorporate feedbacks, both amplifying and regulating, between cause and effect; and they have the potential to undergo regime shifts and display alternate stable states. Their behaviours are made possible by their architecture, which is hierarchical, multi-scalar, and full of redundancy. An important but often ignored element of complexity is the fact that most complex\r\nsystems have a location (or a series of locations, if mobile) in geographic space. Location can determine the ability of a complex adaptive system to persist. For instance, location influences a system’s interactions with other systems, the perturbations that it experiences, its relationships to broader and finer-scale patterns and processes, and its immediate environment. My research programme focuses on the concept of spatial resilience. This body of theory recognizes that spatial variation (e.g., context, gradients, connectivity, network membership, and spatial feedbacks) changes how complex systems adapt, maintain or return to a desired state, and ultimately persist. My students and I combine tools from complexity theory and other disciplines to explore the spatial resilience of complex systems, as exemplified by social-ecological systems (SESs). As a case study, we have recently started to work on protected areas – both private and public - in southern Africa. In particular, we are interested in five focal questions: (1) how do asymmetries in\r\nbiophysical and economic environments influence the emergence of social-ecological\r\nnetworks? (2) How do the locations of network members (nodes) in space affect their\r\nlikelihood of sub-group membership and the properties (e.g., response speed, frequency of interaction) of different networks to which they belong? (3) How do spatially congruent networks interact with one another, and to what extent do they influence one another’s spatial development (e.g., clustering of nodes at different scales) and other properties? (4) How do networks of social-ecological systems develop through time, and can classical landscape ecology variables such as area size, shape, or proximity to other landscape features predict network development and/or explain why some nodes persist and others do not? And lastly, (5) how do local and regional controls relate to one another as drivers of social-ecological resilience, and how rigid are these structures? For example, can local resilience be built independently of national or regional resilience if national governance is weak? Our research will apply complex systems approaches to a clearly articulated question (that of how spatial variation and network membership influence the resilience of protected areas) in several fields of study where they are not mainstream - particularly, conservation biogeography, landscape ecology, ecosystem services, and protected area management.

Such recollection is considered to involve reactivating sensory and perceptual details of an event, and the thoughts and feelings we had at the time, and integrating them into a conscious representation during retrieval.  It makes possible a number of critical decision making abilities, such as distinguishing real experiences from those we might have imagined or been told about.  However, although scientists have discovered a great deal about the cognitive and neural processes that enable us to recall a word list or discriminate studied from novel words, considerably less is known about the processes underlying the subjective phenomenological experience of remembering.  The aim of my research programme is to develop a detailed neurocognitive characterization of subjective memory, to better understand the way it may be impaired in health and disease, and to develop rehabilitation strategies to help those who may have reduced ability to re-experience the past. Subjective experiences associated with memory retrieval are complex and difficult to disentangle.  The thrust of my theoretical and experimental work has been to attempt to understand them in terms of their constituent cognitive processes and to explore the extent to which predicted dissociations emerging from psychological theorizing are observed at the behavioural and neural levels.  My work uses a variety of approaches (behavioural, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, clinical studies, brain stimulation, cognitive remediation) in complementary and creative ways to scrutinize and dissect the cognitive processes that give rise to the multifaceted properties of subjective experience.  In pursuing this, I have begun to identify dissociable cognitive and neural responses associated with aspects of subjective memory across regions of prefrontal, medial temporal, and parietal cortices.  I have shown that these separable patterns of structure and function can be directly related both to inter-subject variability in the general population and to clinical conditions in which the processes appear to be disturbed. My research programme will take this work forward using a combination of neuroimaging and electrophysiological methods to investigate the performance of healthy volunteers on memory tasks that emphasize a number of aspects of subjective remembering.  I will examine the effect on neurocognitive retrieval measures of organic lesions in neuropsychological patients and temporary \"lesions\" in healthy volunteers induced using transcranial magnetic stimulation, as well as of naturally occurring variability in cortical folding patterns.  The results from these different techniques will enable me to develop a comprehensive theory that explains the contribution of cognitive mechanisms subserved by frontal, medial temporal, and parietal regions to subjective memory.

I pursue this question because of my fascination with the fundamental issue that underlies it: how do non-linear feedback processes operating at multiple levels of a dynamical system interact with sources of variation that are outside the system's feedback structure to determine overall system properties? Diversity results from the interplay between abiotic environmental variation (e.g., temperature, humidity, nutrient availability) and the non-linear feedback processes (e.g., density- or frequency-dependence) that underlie biotic interactions (e.g., competition, predation, mutualisms). Elucidating the mechanisms that drive this interplay involves a three-step process.\r\nFirst, one needs to understand how abiotic environmental variation affects the key life history (e.g., fecundity, development, survivorship) and interaction (e.g., attack rates, competition\r\ncoefficients) traits of organisms. Second, one needs to determine how trait responses to environmental variation translate into population-level responses (e.g., per capita growth rates)\r\nvia the positive and negative feedback processes that underlie interactions within and between\r\nspecies. Third, one needs to elucidate how the population-level responses feed back to the trait\r\nresponse, causing the latter to evolve both in response to abiotic environmental variation and\r\nthe biotic selective environment provided by resources, mutualists and natural enemies. These\r\nare the core issues that drive my research program. I pursue them because they are essential to obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that maintain diversity. The interplay between abiotic environmental variation and non-linear biotic interactions\r\ninvolves multiple levels of organization (traits, individuals, populations and communities) with\r\nfeedback processes operating at each level. For instance, different trait types (e.g., life history\r\nvs. interaction traits) exhibit different types of non-linear responses to environmental variation.\r\nThe net effect of such multiple non-linear responses, which manifests as a demographic response\r\nat the organismal level, are highly non-additive. These demographic responses (e.g., per capita\r\nbirth and death rates) in turn drive the non-linear feedbacks arising from interactions within\r\nspecies (e.g., competition) that lead to population regulation (via negative feedback processes)\r\nand interactions between species (e.g., competition, predation, mutualisms) that lead to species\r\ncoexistence (via negative feedback overriding positive feedback). To complete the picture, we\r\nneed to add one more level of complexity: the feedback between ecological dynamics (population regulation and species interactions) and selection on trait responses driven by both abiotic\r\nvariation and biotic interactions. Thus we have a complex system (community) whose properties are driven by the interplay between environmental variability and non-linear feedbacks\r\nat multiple levels (traits, individuals, populations) and dynamics at multiple scales (ecological\r\nand evolutionary). My research therefore falls easily within the purview of the complex systems science that the Foundation envisions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Los Angeles', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020326\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This impression, however, is misleading. Faced with the\r\ninfinite complexity of the world, sensory systems must be selective -- fluidly shifting to focus attention on the objects\r\nand features that are important to action, while leaving the majority of the world largely unanalyzed. Understanding\r\nhow shapes sensory signals into the perceptual representations that guide behavior is thus\r\nfundamental to understanding cognition. However, attention poses a significant scientific problem: even the most\r\nsophisticated computational models of attention fall far short of matching human capabilities, and disruptions to\r\nattention are associated with a spectrum of clinical disorders ranging from impaired focus in the classroom to\r\ndebilitating inabilities to perceive objects across large regions of space. To understand selective attention, my work uses\r\na multidisciplinary combination of theoretical and novel methodological approaches. Perception is based on large populations of feature?selective sensory neurons that pool their output to provide stable\r\nrepresentations of visual features in the environment. Therefore, examining how attention shapes these response\r\nprofiles is necessary to understand how relevant stimuli are efficiently processed. However, predicting and measuring\r\nmodulations at the population level is challenging from both theoretical and empirical points of view. From a theoretical perspective, there is not a single 'optimal' pattern of neural activity that should be universally\r\nadopted when processing a visual stimulus. For instance, most models suggest that attention acts like a volume knob\r\nthat turns up the gain of sensory evoked responses. However, our work suggests that the ideal activity pattern is highly\r\ndependent on the specific perceptual task confronting an observer (e.g. trying to detect your friend wearing a red jacket\r\nversus trying to discriminate a subtle anomaly from normal tissue on a brain scan). Therefore, we employ computational\r\nmodels and information theoretic metrics to predict how attention should ideally modulate population response profiles\r\nin the context of specific behavioral goals. From an empirical perspective, measuring feature?selective response profiles in human visual cortex is daunting. Even\r\nthough non?invasive techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are capable of indexing activation\r\nchanges across large populations of sensory neurons, traditional analysis techniques largely discard feature?selective\r\ninformation. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a set of sophisticated analytic tools to measure changes in\r\nfeature?selective response profiles using fMRI signals. In contrast to increasingly popular 'multivoxel pattern analysis'\r\ntechniques, our approach maps explicit models of neural tuning functions onto observed changes in fMRI signals. Thus,\r\nwe can evaluate theory?driven questions about attention modulates population responses in human visual cortex\r\nwith a high degree of precision. By bridging these theoretical and empirical approaches, research in my lab critically evaluates novel ideas about how\r\nattention facilitates information processing at the level of population codes in visual cortex. Moreover, by establishing a\r\ncomplete link between theory, data, and behavior, our approach will support new insights into the functional properties\r\nof attentional modulations, which is a key element in building models that can account for deficits that arise when\r\nselective attention goes awry.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - San Diego', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020329\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Direct and indirect interactions between mitogenic and maturation pathways influence central nervous system (CNS) precursor cell decisions to divide or commit to a terminal differentiation program [1, 2]. Alterations in the balance between pro-proliferative and pro-differentiation signals may set the stage for cancer, by establishing conditions conducive for cell transformation, or cause precocious cell cycle exit, leading to developmental disorders. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly evident that aberrant regulation of signaling pathways controlling normal development promotes cancer [3, 4]. Such dysregulation, resulting from mutations or altered activity of genes encoding signal transduction pathway components, can cause tumor cells-of-origin to increase proliferation, fail to exit the cell cycle, or fail to die in the event of genetic damage, thereby acquiring new mutations that may enhance their survival capacity. The childhood brain tumor medulloblastoma is an example of a cancer resulting from developmental mis-cues for cell division, or failure to undergo growth arrest. This tumor, which is the most common pediatric malignancy and a leading cause of cancer deaths in children, arises in the cerebellum during post-natal development [5]. Current treatments for medulloblastoma, which include radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy, fail to distinguish between the tumor cells and the normal cells of the still-developing brain, leaving survivors with life-long devastating side-effects, including behavioral and cognitive disorders. Insufficient radiation or incomplete resection are associated with tumor recurrence and spread thoughout the cerebral spinal fluid to distal sites in the central nervous system. However, development of more optimal treatments has been hampered by a lack of understanding of the basic mechanisms contributing to medulloblastoma cell-of-origin transformation, tumor expansion, and recurrence/spread. The overall goals of my research program are (a) to characterize how mitogenic/oncogenic signaling pathways cooperate at the cell biological and molecular genetic level to promote medulloblastoma formation and growth; (b) use primary cultures, brain slice explants, and genetically engineered mice to validate such nodes of cooperativity as potential targets for new medulloblastoma therapies; (c) to apply the insights gained from my basic research to the clinic, in collaborative translational research. The cerebellum regulates movement and posture. Cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNPs) proliferate rapidly during a post-natal expansion phase, before terminally differentiating into glutamatergic interneurons [6]. CGNPs are proposed cells-of-origin for certain classes of medulloblastoma [7, 8], particularly those associated with aberrant activation of the pathway stimulated by the secreted morphogen Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) [9]. Such tumors comprise approximately 30% of medulloblastoma cases, as determined by gene expression profiling. An increased understanding of how Shh signaling triggers neural precursor cell cycle progression, by interacting with pathways that regulate cell size, new protein synthesis, and metabolic control, will lead to identification of new medulloblastoma therapy targets as well as improve our understanding of basic brain developmental biology and how its dys-regulation prompts tumor formation. In the event of an incomplete resection or an effort to reduce radiation doses to spare side effects such as intellectual impairment, tumors recur and metastasize as a result of activation of so-called \"tumor re-initiating cells\". These cells are known to reside adjacent to blood vessels in tumors, a region known as the \"peri-vascular niche (PVN). Signaling in this region is proposed to generate a unique microenvironment that supports quiescence of these cells until they are stimulated to divide and re-grow the tumor. This unique microenvironment involves signaling by Shh and our preliminary studies also show that there are tumor-specific metabolic choices taken by these cells, which could be exploited in therapies aimed at eradicating these cells and enabling reduced radiation levels during medulloblastoma treatment. In agreement with our preliminary studies, recent studies have demonstrated that cancer cells acquire and become dependent upon unique metabolic pathways that cause them to exhibit fuel preference choices and regulation of intracellular lipid synthesis distinct from that of normal cells [5]. Defining how essential metabolic pathways are altered or co-opted in medulloblastomas, which to date remain poorly understood, may lead to new therapeutic modalities. My co-investigator Dr. Zaher Nahle (Weill Cornell Medical College)and I have made the novel observation that Shh signaling is tightly coupled to the reprogramming of mitochondrial bioenergetics; specifically that Shh inhibits the critical process of fatty acid oxidation (FAO, or β-oxidation) while driving the increase in fatty acid synthesis (FAS), which is required for lipid synthesis. The effects of Shh on modifying lipid metabolism are seen in normal development -primary cultures of CGNPs -as well as in Shh-mediated mouse medulloblastomas. Thus, our studies link developmental and oncogenic Shh signaling to the basal metabolic machinery regulating fuel production and biosynthetic processes associated with cell proliferation. The objective of my James S. McDonnell Foundation proposal is to identify mechanisms through which the developmentally critical Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and newly-described Hippo signaling pathways interact to regulate CGNP proliferation and medulloblastoma growth, survival, and recurrence. The Shh pathway is highly conserved through evolution from to mammals, and functions by activating a signal transduction pathway leading to expression and activation of transcription factors whose target genes determine the outcome of pathway activation. For example, activation of Shh signaling in the ventral spinal cord results in induction of specific motor neuron subtypes. In contrast, Shh pathway activation in the developing cerebellum and several other progenitor populations causes proliferation. Like the Shh signaling pathway, the Hippo pathway is highly evolutionarily conserved. This pathway is tumor suppressive, and promotes growth arrest when activated, by causing phosphorylation and degradation of a transcriptional regulator known as yes-associated protein-1 (YAP1). YAP1 has been identified as an oncogene in breast and liver cancers, and is amplified in several tumors including glioma. YAP1 operates by binding to specific transcription factor partners, recruiting proteins to activate the gene-regulatory properties of these transcription factors. Target genes regulated by YAP1 are therefore determined by its interacting partners, and studies in cell line systems have identified YAP1 targets including genes involved in proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. In the developing chick spinal cord, YAP1 has been shown to promote maintenance of an undifferentiated neural precursor state [11]. However, little is known of its function in the developing mammalian nervous system. We have recently shown that in the developing cerebellum, Shh induces expression, stabilization, and nuclear localization of YAP1. YAP1 activity was required for CGNP proliferation and, indeed, YAP1 was able to drive CGNP proliferation independent of Shh. Moreover, we found that YAP1 was up-regulated and amplified in human medulloblastomas belonging to the Shh subclass, indicating a conservation of mechanism beween cerebellar development and medulloblastoma formation [12]. The interaction between Shh signaling and Hippo suppression/YAP1 activation plays essential roles in CGNP proliferation. Mechanisms through which this pathway cross-talk takes place, whether it can be generalized to other neural precursor populations which themselves may be cells-of-origin for other pediatric cancers, how YAP1 specifically contributes to medulloblastoma initiation and the role played by YAP1 in cell cycle regulation and Shh-mediated lipid metabolism in medulloblastoma recurrence remain to be determined. These questions form the core of our proposed JSMF research. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether interactions between Shh, Hippo/YAP1, and metabolic pathway may be targeted in new medulloblastoma therapies aimed at reducing current required levels of radiation and chemotherapy, while preventing tumor recurrence. Moreover, since metabolic de-regulation is found in many highly proliferative tumors, including some with neuronal origins, and hedgehog pathway activity has been implicated in a number of neoplasms, including those of lung, prostate, and pancreas, our research has the potential to be applicable to a broad spectrum of tumors.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020248\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In the US in 2009, estimated new cases of brain cancer were 22,070 out of which 12,920 cases were estimated to die. The brain is composed of nerve cells or neurons that are supported by glial cells that include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia. Glial cells account for more than 90% of brain cells. Most of the brain tumors originate from glial cells and are known as gliomas. Astrocytomas, composed predominantly of neoplastic astrocytes, account for 80-85% of all gliomas and are staged as low grade (grade I) to high grade (grade IV) based on their aggressive behavior. Glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV astrocytoma; GBM) is an extremely aggressive, invasive and destructive malignancy with a 2-5 times faster proliferation rate than grade III tumors. GBM patients have a median survival of only 10 to 12 months despite aggressive therapy. Although GBM does not spread to distant organs, i.e., it does not metastasize, it has highly invasive capacity into surrounding normal brain. As such extensive surgical resection is not curative since remnants of invasive GBM cells are always left behind in the normal brain. Moreover, GBM is largely resistant to current treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Even after aggressive therapies, recurrence of GBM is a common event and accounts for the fatal outcome of the disease. As such, understanding the molecular mechanism of GBM pathogenesis, especially its invasive properties, is of vital importance for developing a targeted therapy to eradicate this fatal malady and promote disease-free survival. Our search for molecules playing important role in regulating development and progression of GBM identified Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) as a key molecule in this process. Interestingly, AEG-1 has been identified to promote development and progression of not only GBM but also a variety of other cancers that include cancers of liver, breast, prostate, esophagus and lungs, melanoma and neuroblastoma. In all these diseases AEG-1 expression was significantly and markedly higher in cancer patients compared to normal individuals and the higher expression level of AEG-1 correlated with poorer prognosis of the disease. Our findings demonstrate that AEG-1 expression is significantly increased, compared to normal brain, in more than 90% of ~100 brain cancer patients analyzed, the majority of these patients suffering from GBM. Overexpression of a gene in such a high percentage of patients has not been demonstrated for any other gene. GBM is notorious for its invasion into the surrounding normal brain that results in recurrence of the disease after surgical resection. We demonstrated that AEG-1 plays a key role in mediating invasion of GBM cells by activating the intracellular signaling molecule NF-κB. NF-κB is known to regulate the expression of many genes necessary for tumor development, progression, invasion and metastasis and we documented that AEG-1 activates NF-κB by directly interacting with this molecule. When AEG-1 expression was inhibited by small inhibitory RNAs (siRNA), there was marked decrease in invading capacity of GBM cells. Additionally, inhibition of AEG-1 by siRNA strongly inhibited growth of primary human GBM cells implanted into the brain of athymic nude mice. In addition to facilitating invasion and metastasis, end-stage events in cancer, AEG-1 also promotes earlier events in carcinogenesis facilitating transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. In addition, AEG-1 also promotes new blood vessel formation or angiogenesis and confers resistance to chemotherapeutics, two important hallmarks of aggressive cancers. All these findings strongly suggest that AEG-1 plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of cancer, including GBM, and AEG-1 inhibition might be an effective therapeutic strategy to cure the patients of this fatal disease. The intriguing properties of AEG-1 promoting tumorigenesis have been elucidated by cell culture studies as well as studies using human GBM cells implanted in athymic nude mouse which lack functioning immune system thereby allowing growth of human cancer cells without immune-mediated rejection. These studies are vital to establish the tumorigenic properties of a new oncogene. However, these findings need to be further confirmed by more stringent animal models. If AEG-1 is really important for tumor development and progression, what will happen if AEG-1 is absent? Based on the strong data obtained so far, one would hypothesize that in the absence of AEG-1, cancer, if it develops at all, would significantly lose its aggressiveness. In case of GBM one would argue that lack of AEG-1 would abrogate invasion of GBM into surrounding normal brain so that the cancer might be completely removed by surgical resection resulting in cure. This hypothesis can be validated by an animal model in which AEG-1 expression is knocked out selectively in particular organs or cell types. Since GBMs arise from astrocytes, developing an animal model in which AEG-1 expression is knocked out exclusively in astrocytes would be a valuable model to analyze the hypothesis. Current technologies based on 'Cre-loxP' system facilitates this approach where a gene might be deleted in specific organs or cell types utilizing a tissue-specific or cell-type specific promoter. Indeed, using similar system, Dr. DePinho's laboratory has generated a mouse model of GBM where two tumor suppressor genes p53 and PTEN have been selectively knocked down in astrocytes. This mouse model develops aggressive GBM mimicking the human disease. It would be interesting to see what happens if AEG-1 is knocked down in this model. Will this GBM model lose its aggressive properties in the absence of AEG-1? We are currently in the process of generating a mouse line in which AEG-1 is selectively knocked down in astrocytes. We have already generated the necessary reagents to create such a mouse line which will be ready in very near future. This astrocyte-specific AEG-1 knock-out mouse (AEG- 1KO mouse) will be crossed with the astrocyte-specific p53 and PTEN knock-out model of GBM to establish the importance of AEG-1 in GBM progression. The animals will be subjected to a battery of histological, immunological and molecular analyses to establish our hypothesis. The AEG-1KO mouse will be used to identify novel AEG-1 downstream genes mediating its functions. Although AEG-1 expression is profoundly higher in GBM, in normal brain AEG-1 is also expressed although at a low level. The presence of low level of AEG-1 in normal astrocytes indicates that AEG-1 might serve some physiological function. The brain functions are regulated by neurotransmitters which relay information in the brain and glutamate is a very important neurotransmitter. Glutamate accumulates in the synapses, where two neurons or a neuron or an astrocyte meet, and stimulates the neurons to activity. However, glutamate level needs to be maintained at a very critical level in synapses. Excessive glutamate accumulation in synapses results in too much excitation of neurons leading to their death, a phenomenon called excitotoxicity. Astrocytes contain glutamate transporters that remove glutamate from the synapses back into the astrocytes thereby maintaining critical glutamate concentration. The major glutamate transporter in astrocytes is EAAT2. We have identified that AEG-1 downregulates EAAT2 expression. In GBM, AEG-1 overexpression with associated decrease in EAAT2 results in toxic accumulation of glutamate in synapses leading to neuronal death. On the other hand in the absence of AEG-1, EAAT2 expression might be increased resulting in reduced levels of glutamate in the synapses leading to impairment of neuronal function. The AEG-1 KO model will thus provide insights into the physiological function of AEG-1 in normal brain. The animal would be subjected to analysis of motor and behavioral skills as well as learning and memory tests to check the role of AEG-1 in normal brain function in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Porter in the Department of Psychology.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Virginia Commonwealth University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020251\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

There is a great need for improved therapeutic options and detection of recurrent disease. Although\r\nGBM is characterized by abnormal activation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways, therapeutic\r\ntargeting of single kinases has been largely disappointing. Two major factors may be contributing to the limited\r\nefficacy of these targeted therapeutics. First, GBM is driven by the summation of multiple growth signaling\r\ninputs [1]. Second, GBMs are heterogeneous and there are clinically distinct subtypes, based on expression,\r\ngenomic and proteomic profiling [2-7]. Thus, different tumor subtypes may be dependent on different patterns\r\nof oncogenic signaling. Successful clinical responses to treatment will therefore require the development of\r\nnovel therapies that target multiple signaling pathways, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms\r\ndriving abnormal cell signaling in the different human tumor subtypes. We are investigating the factors in the tumor microenvironment in the human brain that drive oncogenic\r\nsignaling and promote malignant astrocytoma. Our focus on extracellular determinants of disease is driven by a\r\ndesire to identify novel, druggable therapeutic targets for GBM. In our studies, we have identified a novel\r\nmechanism by which and drive tumor growth [8]. In this proposal to the James S. McDonnell Foundation, we\r\ntest the novel hypothesis  RTK signaling pathways regulate many aspects of human gliomagenesis including cell proliferation, cell\r\nsurvival, invasion, and angiogenesis. In GBM, abnormal activation of these pathways can be driven by altered\r\nligand availability and altered receptor levels. Indeed, the two most commonly amplified genes in GBM are\r\nEGFR and PDGFRA [6, 9-11]. Once released from the cell, oncogenic ligands can be sequestered by the\r\nextracellular microenvironment limiting their availability. Enzymatic release from the extracellular matrix is\r\none important mechanism regulating their post-synthetic availability. In certain tumors, may be a critical and tumorigenesis and this\r\nshould be tested and translated for therapeutic benefit. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and HSPG-modifying enzymes, present on the cell surface and in the\r\nextracellular matrix, are upregulated and constitute a major component of the extracellular environment in\r\nGBM [12, 13]. In many tissues including the brain, HSPGs play a key role in a number of biological processes\r\nbased on their ability to bind and regulate the activity of diverse protein ligands including growth factors,\r\nchemokines, and morphogens, such as PDGF, VEGF and FGF [14-18]. In cancer, dysregulated HSPGs have\r\nthe potential to alter the activity of multiple cell signaling pathways. Indeed, altered expression of HSPGs and\r\nHSPG modifying enzymes is common in cancer. The SULFs are extracellular enzymes that act on HSPGs to\r\nliberate ligands from sequestration and promote cell signaling. They are broadly overexpressed in many human\r\ncancers, including glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer,\r\nhead and neck cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, multiple myeloma, and gastric carcinoma [19, 20]. In\r\nhuman GBM we identified robust SULF2 expression in tumor cells; and, using knockdown and transgenic\r\napproaches, we demonstrated SULF2 promotes tumor cell proliferation, tumor growth , and the activity\r\nof multiple RTKs, including PDGFRα[8]. Together, these data support a critical role for HSPGs in the\r\nupstream regulation of multiple signaling pathways in GBM. For the majority of GBM patients, current treatment is not tailored to the patient’s tumor molecular phenotype,\r\nbut this will change with elucidation of subtype-specific patterns of oncogenic signaling. While robust criteria\r\nfor clinical tumor stratification are still evolving, it is important to incorporate the molecular and phosphoproteomic\r\nphenotype of the tumor into the development and validation of novel biomarkers and therapeutics.\r\nOur studies suggest high-level expression of HSPG-modifying SULF2 may denote tumors that are more\r\ndependent on exogenous ligand [8]. This is a very exciting result as it suggests detection of SULF2, or alterations in HSPGs, may help identify a subset of tumors that are more amenable to specific therapies\r\nincluding multi-RTK inhibition. Our overall objective is to To do this we will first stratify recurrent human GBMs\r\nbased upon phospho-proteome profiling and molecular phenotype, including expression of HSPGs and HSPGmodifying\r\nenzymes. We will then test specific associations using recurrent human GBM xenografts and gene\r\nknockdown approaches. To measure the sensitivity and specificity of plasma HSPG and HSPG-modifying\r\nenzyme levels for recurrent GBM, we will compare plasma levels in GBM patients and age-matched controls\r\nand in the same patient before and after tumor resection. Next, we will test the efficacy of therapeutic agents\r\nthat target SULF2 and HSPGs using human GBM xenografts. Based on our preliminary studies, extracellular\r\nHSPGs, and the enzymes that modify them, play important roles in GBM, and their detection in patient blood\r\nmay provide a robust biomarker of disease.

Cancer involves defects in the ability of the cell to accurately proof-read DNA during replication, as well as aberrations in the cell signaling pathways that normally transduce information from outside the cell into intracellular compartments and the nucleus. The normal machinery of programmed cell death is disrupted in cancer cells and constitutive activation of catalytic processes short-circuit the elegant signaling network that normally allows a cell to signal that an important change has occurred in the environment to which it must respond. In this feed forward cycle of constantly responding to a perceived stress the deleterious mutations accumulate until a cell becomes transformed. Among the most intractable of cancers are Glioblastoma Multiforms (GBMs), which typically have a poor prognosis and short median survival times. This is a devastating disease and therapeutic options are currently limited. Several obstacles are associated with successful treatment of GBMs. First, these tumors are not encapsulated and, because they are highly invasive, tend to spread to other regions before they are diagnosed. In addition, many conventional chemotherapeutic agents cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore do not reach the site of malignancy. Several well characterized oncogenic mutations in GMBs are known to cause constitutive activation in lipid signaling pathways. RAS GTPase is frequently mutated in human glioblastomas, leading to activation of PI3Kinase and subsequent activation of Akt. Phospholipase D (PLD) is intimately associated with this pathway. PLD is activated by oncogenic forms of tyrosine kinase receptors, such as EGFR. Phosphatidic acid (PA) generated by PLD is an essential modulator of pathways that directly regulate levels of PI(3,4,5)P3. PA is a membrane binding site for Raf kinase and has also been shown to modulate sphingosine kinase and the mTOR pathway. We recently discovered that PLD is in complex with Akt and appears to modulate the phosphorylation state of the kinase. PLD catalytic activity is hyperactivated in human GBMs, but it has not previously been possible to interrogate the therapeutic possibilities of this target. In collaboration with the laboratory of Craig Lindsley we have designed and synthesized the first isoenzyme selective inhibitors of PLD1 and PLD2 (Scott et al., 2009 Nature Chemical Biology) and additional compounds with increased potency and efficacy have been developed. The initial description of these compounds focused on effects in breast cancer cells, but subsequent work identified that human glioblastomas frequently have very high levels of PLD catalytic activity and the effects of the inhibitors on blocking invasiveness are striking (Figure, at left). Preliminary results show   that inhibition of PLD generated product, PA, effectively blocks invasive migration of a glioblastoma derived cell line, U87-MG. Our synthesized lead compounds have high selectivity (>1700 for EVJ) and potencies below 1 nM. The goal of this proposal is to refine pharmacological properties of the compounds, define the molecular mechanism of these compounds (i.e. how PLD inhibitors block invasive migration), and optimize the medicinal chemistry to develop a preclinical candidate. The long term goal of this research is to determine whether PLD is an effective therapeutic target for the treatment of GBMs alone and/or if it synergizes with other therapeutic targets to effectively block GBM progression. Our hypothesis operates from the premise that no single agent will be entirely successful unto itself in treating brain cancers, but PLD may be a critical node that leads to more successful therapy. If validated we will seek to partner with a pharmaceutical company to develop our lead compound into a suitable candidate for clinical trials. Support from the McDonnell Foundation will be critical at this phase. The central hypothesis to be tested in this research is that targeted ablation of the signaling pool of PA generated by PLD will be sufficient to significantly block invasive migration of GBMs and in combination with other signaling pathway inhibitors will provide a novel pharmacological agent that can block invasive migration, extend survival times and augment therapeutic treatment. The specific aims include: The overall goal of this research plan is to develop potent (subnanomolar) and highly selective (isoenzyme specificity) that minimize off-target effects. The unique approach in our research plan is that novel small molecules are synthesized and immediately screened in two parallel, and highly complementary, approaches. The compounds are screened in a biochemical assay in which only purified PLD1 or PLD2 are present with chemical defined lipid vesicles. This assures that the chemical series is working directly on the phospholipase. The assay details are described in detail (Brown et al., 1993 Cell; Brown et al., 2007 Methods in Enzymology). The parallel assay utilizes a cell-based approach in systems in which exclusive PLD1 and PLD2 responses have been established. The cellular PLD transphosphatidylation activity is measured by analysis of the formation of phosphatidylbutanol, which an alternate catalytic product of PLD. Other glycerophospholipid species are monitored in parallel. Offtarget effects in other lipid signaling pathways are detected in the analysis of the spectrum. In contrast to many drug-discovery approaches we are able to identify immediately if a new series of compounds is ineffective or has substantial off-target effects. This allows us to rapidly assess SAR and focus on more productive chemical modifications. We have multiple series of compounds that inhibit PLD. Preliminary results reveal that the major effects of these inhibitors are to block invasive migration. Given that GMBs have high levels of constitutively produced PA and a major cause of death due to these tumors is uncontrolled invasiveness, PLD is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Our results have focused in the matrigel invasion assays, but we propose to extend these studies into 3-dimensional anchorage independent growth assays. A number of relevant biological parameters will also be measured including effects on cell growth, apoptosis, sensitivity to irradiation and other chemotherapeutic agents, endocytosis of EGFR, and changes in metabolic pathways as biomarkers. This will serve as the primary determination for which compounds should be used for analysis of in vivo tumor models. These studies will also provide important information on penetrance and metabolism of the inhibitors. The primary and secondary metabolites will be measured by online HPLC-ESI-MS. Given the complexity of metabolites in glioblastomas, it may be necessary to utilize chemical probes. We have recently developed a new form of Click chemistry in which alkyne-labelled probes can be covalently complexed to cobalt and resolved from other biomolecules. This is essentially \"affinity chromatography\" for small molecule metabolites (Milne et al., 2010, Nature Chemical Biology). This approach allows us to detect metabolites after prolong periods of treatments with multiple biotransformation steps. This will facilitate our understanding of the metabolic fate of our small molecule inhibitors as well as assess bioactive compounds within the in vivo model.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2010', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

With the recent in-depth molecular characterization of glioblastoma by the NIH Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others, these tumors can now be robustly categorized amongst distinct molecular subclasses (1-4). However, the clinical impact of this upfront classification is yet unknown. At the same time, a massively elevated mutation frequency has been uncovered within recurrent glioblastomas by large-scale genome sequencing (5-7). These tumor recurrences evade chemotherapy through somatic inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway (8-10). Intriguingly, detailed examination of TCGA datasets reveals that hypermutator recurrences arise uniformly from a specific subclass of primary glioblastomas. This preliminary observation raises the possibility that a tumor's response to treatment could be predicted in part based upon pre-treatment molecular classifiers, and holds the promise for upfront individualized therapy to close off potential treatment escape pathways. Herein, we propose to analyze the relationship between treatment response, and upfront versus recurrent tumor-specific characteristics, to better understand the development of therapeutic resistance. As the most common primary human brain tumor, glioblastomas are associated with a median survival of less than two years (11). The standard-of-care treatment is surgical resection followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy with the DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide. Prospective randomized clinical trials have shown that this combined adjuvant regimen results in a statistically-significant prolongation of life (12, 13). Nonetheless, virtually all patients suffer tumor regrowth that is resistant to prior therapies and ultimately leads to the patient's death. Glioblastoma has been an important focus of the recent National Cancer Institute's TCGA. This critical infrastructure investment has led to a significant advance in our knowledge of the fundamental genomic alterations in this cancer. As a result, we now have detailed information about a broad study sample of glioblastomas prior to initial therapy, and subsequently when they recur after treatment failure. These resources provide the basis for the identification of the genetic mechanisms which link these two scenarios (upfront presentation and recurrence) in individual patients. Amongst the key advantages of TCGA datasets are the multi-platform, multidimensional molecular analyses that are performed across the common core tumor sample set. The rationale for this design was to provide a framework to allow for the generation of hypotheses that would not otherwise be apparent from isolated data collections. Ongoing large-scale characterization of glioblastoma gene expression profiles has categorized the TCGA tumors into different subclasses within a proneural mesenchymal axis (2). However, while there is good evidence demonstrating a distinct genetic identity between subclasses (2, 16), there is controversy whether clinicallyrelevant differences exist between the groupings that cannot be explained by known differences between grade and histological categorization (17, 18). At the same time, large-scale genome sequencing of recurrent glioblastomas by multiple groups (including our own) has discovered a hypermutation phenotype from somatic MMR pathway inactivation, linked to alkylator chemotherapeutic resistance and treatment failure (5-10). Approximately one-quarter of glioblastomas recurrent in patients receiving temozolomide have somatic hypermutation across the genome. The local sequence context of this hypermutation is indicative of a mutator phenotype arising during treatment. Furthermore, somatic inactivating mutations of the MMR genes MSH6, MSH2, and MLH1 are found in these recurrences, but not in any untreated tumors (5, 6, 8, 10). Interestingly, the earliest rounds of TCGA data acquisition inadvertently included posttreatment recurrent tumors in the analyses. This fortuitous oversight provided the unique opportunity to carefully analyze this abundance of large-scale sequencing information with regards to the timing of MMR inactivation, firmly establishing the finding of MMR inactivation in a significant proportion of alkylator treatment failures. Interestingly, these observations in human tumors mirror studies from earlier decades which identified MMR pathway inactivation as a mediator of alkylator resistance in vitro (15). Accordingly, MMR-deficiency serves as an route of emergent alkylator resistance in these patients (10). This common molecular defect driving chemoresistance in human tumors represents an exciting opportunity for the design of improved treatment strategies to exploit this defective pathway. With robust molecular sub-classifiers now available for both upfront primary glioblastomas and the subsequent emergence of treatment resistance, it is crucial to now understand the relationship between these groups in individual patients, as well as the relationship between sub-class and clinically-meaningful outcome measures. A strong association with treatment outcome would have significant translational impact, and provide a basis for the promise of personalized therapy. In our analyses of TCGA hypermutator datasets, we have found that the recurrences examined from primary glioblastomas seem to arise uniformly from the mesenchymal subclass. While this observation is preliminary and needs to be confirmed in more samples, it raises the possibility that a tumor's response to treatment can be predicted upfront. Indeed, if the mechanism of treatment failure for a given glioblastoma subclass can be predicted to be MMR-deficiency, that treatment escape pathway could potentially be closed off with targeted salvage therapies or an upfront combination regimen. We therefore hypothesize that it may be possible to identify treatment-related factors that differ between subclasses amongst otherwise histologically-indistinguishable primary glioblastomas. To test this hypothesis, we propose to assess treatment response to both standard-of-care and experimental salvage therapies, and overall outcomes, within the different sub-classes of both de novo primary glioblastomas and post-treatment recurrences.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020249\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '100,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The first feature of these deadly tumors presents a continuous challenge for complete surgical resection of glioblastoma and a difficult task for radiation and chemotherapies. The latter refers to the formation of blood vessels in high-grade glioblastoma that allows rapid glioma tumor growth and aggressive tumor invasion in the brain. Disappointedly, despite rapid advance in treatment by surgical removal, radiation, chemo- and immuno-therapies, the median survival time of patients with malignant glioblastoma remains 12 to 16 months. This clinical challenge underscores the importance of better understanding of mechanisms underlying these two malignant features of malignant glioblastomas and developing novel therapeutic regiments to treat these deadly brain cancers. The major function of glioma angiogenesis is to supply nutrients, oxygen, various necessary substances to the tumors, and remove metabolic wastes from the tumors. In theory, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by cutting off the nourishment and blocking the waste disposal will starve tumors to death, thus effectively shrinking malignant glioblastoma. Consequently, anti-angiogenic treatments that target angiogenic stimulators such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by glioma cells and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) in tumor endothelial cells at the inner lining of blood vessels are used with increasing frequency to treat patients with glioblastoma (1). Following its FDA approval as monotherapy for recurrent high-grade glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in 2009, Bevacizumab (Bev), a VEGFspecific monoclonal antibody, has entered mainstream clinical treatments for malignant GBMs. However, various phase II clinical trials reported that treatment of glioblastoma patients with Bev in combination with chemotherapeutic agents showed brief initial response. Afterwards, almost 100% patients who received Bev inevitably developed even more malignant phenotype; glioblastoma has become more aggressively invasive in the brain. As a result patients quickly succumb to the disease. Furthermore, these clinical observations have been corroborated by two recent preclinical studies using various tumor xenograft models including gliomas in animals. Our group has a long-standing interest in studying the mechanisms of glioma angiogenesis and invasion, and exploring therapeutic approaches to overcome these two malignant phenotypes of glioblastomas. In our studies of glioma angiogenesis and invasion, we reported that the growth factor angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is capable of stimulating malignant glioma invasion in the brain as well as promoting breast cancer metastasis to distant organs of animals (2). Additionally, Dr. S. Ferrone, a co-investigator of this study had studied chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) in other types of human cancers (3). CSPG4 has been demonstrated to promote glioma cell invasion (4). In our preliminary studies, we established a glioma model that mimics this malignant phenotype in the brain of animals. When glioma-derived VEGF is trapped by a soluble VEGFR, thus lost its function, VEGFstimulated endothelial cell migration is inhibited in vitro. In the brain, inhibition of gliomaderived VEGF by this trap induces aggressive glioma invasion in the brain of mice. We found that expression of Ang2 and CSPG4 are increased in invasive sVEGFR gliomas compared with controls. In peripheral blood of mice bearing these invasive brain gliomas, serum levels of these two proteins are increased compared to mice bearing non-invasive brain tumors. Significantly, serum levels of Ang2 and CSPG4 are also elevated in serum samples from glioblastoma patients treated with Bev compared to normal individuals. Our overall hypothesis of this study is that Bev inhibition of VEGF signaling in GBMs induces tumor cell invasion through up-regulation of Ang2 and CSPG4 activating unique signaling pathways. Therefore, simultaneously targeting of VEGF signaling and of the evoked glioma invasion should overcome this malignant phenotype and be effective in treatment of diffuse glioblastomas. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following questions: 1) What are the mechanisms by which anti-VEGF therapy up-regulates Ang2 and CSPG4 inducing glioma cell invasion? 2) Can we inhibit anti-VEGF-induced glioma invasion by targeting up-regulated Ang2, CSPG4 and activated signaling? 3) Can we establish Ang2 and CSPG4 as well as other molecules as biomarkers predictive of anti-angiogenic therapy-induced glioma invasion? To address these questions, we propose three specific aims in this study. In our first specific aim, we will identify the key modulators that up-regulate Ang2 and CSPG4 in response to anti-angiogenesis therapy in glioma cells. Previous studies showed that expression of Ang2 in endothelial cells, a cervical cancer cell line called HeLa cells and adipose tissues could be induced by hypoxia, i.e. low oxygen condition that frequently occurs in rapidly-growing gliomas and also can be caused by inhibition of VEGF and angiogenesis through several molecules such as HIF1-α, ETS-1 and FOXC2 that control gene transcription. We will first examine whether hypoxic condition induces Ang2 and CSPG4 in glioma cells when VEGF is inhibited and whether other types of brain cells are also involved. Then, we will separately remove these three genes from the glioma cells using siRNA knockdown technology and test whether hypoxia and brain cells still capable of inducing Ang2 and CSPG4 in glioma cells. This aim will identify the modulators of Ang2 and CSPG4 expression that are responsible for anti-VEGF-induced Ang2 and CSPG4 and the induced glioma invasion. In our second specific aim, we will perform proof-of-principle preclinical studies to explore therapeutic approaches for overcoming the anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioma invasion in the brain. We will use siRNAs to deplete Ang2 and CSPG4 in glioma cells that glioma-derived VEGF is trapped and in clinical relevant primary glioblastoma cells that maintain clinical features of tumor invasion and gene alterations. We will assess the impact of Ang2 and CSPG4 depletion on anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioma invasion in the brain. Next, we will separately deplete HIF1-α, ETS-1 and FOXC2 in these cells and examine the impact on glioma invasion. Lastly, we will use a 7T magnet resonance (MR) imager designed for small animals installed at our animal facility. With help of coinvestigators who are experts of MR imaging, we will employ MRI analyses to evaluate antiangiogenesis therapy-induced glioma invasion and glioma responses to the combined inhibition in the brain of animals. This aim will identify Ang2, CSPG4 and other molecules as therapeutic targets for combined therapies with anti-angiogenesis drugs and chemotherapeutic agents to treat the malignant glioblastomas and obtain critical MRI data useful for clinical MRI analyses and diagnosis. In our third specific aim, we will determine whether an increase in serum levels of Ang2 and CSPG4 in the peripheral blood of glioma patients treated with Bev correlates with disease progression. Accumulated clinical data shows that elevated serum levels of Ang2 and CSPG4 are closely linked to tumor progression, invasion and metastasis and patient survival in various types of human cancers including glioblastomas (2, 3). In collaboration with a neuro-oncologist/physician-scientist, Dr. H. Okada, we will prospectively collect serum samples from glioblastoma patients who will be treated with Bev after their diagnosis of glioblastoma. We will determine the serum levels of Ang2, CSPG4 as well as other proteins in sera of these patients after the diagnosis and onward during the Bev treatments. We will also compare the serum levels of these proteins of Bev-treated glioma patients with normal individuals. Lastly, with help of the Biostatistics Core at our NCI-designated comprehensive Cancer Center, the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, we will correlate serum levels of these proteins that changed in response to anti-angiogenesis therapy with disease progression of glioblastomas in response to anti-angiogenesis therapy. This aim will establish Ang2, CSPG4 as well as several other proteins as robust biomarkers predictive for anti-angiogenic therapy-induced glioma invasion during the treatment of glioblastomas. In clinic, the malignant phenotype of anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioma invasion remains a major obstacle and a challenging problem for which no effective salvaging therapy has identified. Based on our novel findings and functions of Ang2 and CSPG4 in inducing glioma invasion and tumor metastasis, we propose to investigate the role and mechanism of Ang2 and CSPG4 in promoting anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioblastoma invasion. This study is highly innovative with significant clinical impacts since we will not only elucidate the novel role of Ang2 and CSPG4 in anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioblastoma invasion and the underlying mechanisms, identify Ang2, CSPG4 and their modulators as potential therapeutic targets, but we will also establish Ang2, CSPG4 and other molecules as prognostic biomarkers predictive for this adverse phenotype. Additionally, this proposal draws the unique strength of a highly collaborative research team comprised of several established investigators with distinct expertise in immunotherapy for human cancers and glioblastomas, MRI analysis of human cancers and a physician-scientist, thus warranting its likely success. Completion of this study will add elucidation to pathophysiology of the resistance to anti-angiogenic treatment, allow us to explore therapeutic approaches to inhibit the anti-angiogenesis therapy-induced glioma invasion and provide information to monitor glioma progression in response to Bev treatment and implement different therapies in these patients in a timely fashion.

Conformational diseases give rise to neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease as well as prion encephalopathies, and non‐neurodegenerative conditions, such as diabetes, cataract, medullary carcinoma and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. The largest group of conformational diseases, amyloidosis, is associated with the conversion of native proteins to highly organized fibrillar aggregates known as amyloids. Protein aggregation into amyloids is initiated by an activated monomer, such as a misfolded protein. Monomers aggregate together to form oligomers. The oligomers form protofilaments and eventually organize into fibril structures. Protein aggregates can be toxic to cells and may ultimately lead to disease as a result of improper trafficking, premature protein degradation, or misfolding of native proteins. The formation of protein aggregates in conformational diseases often displays a threshold phenomenon that is characterized by a sudden shift between nontoxic to toxic levels of protein aggregates. This phenomenon is observed, for example, in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease where patients with the disease exhibit high aggregation levels and express a form of the huntingtin protein with 38-182 polyglutamine residues, while patients without the disease exhibit low aggregation levels and express a form of the protein with 8-37 polyglutamine residues. Thus, the disease appears when a critical length of 37 glutamine residues is exceeded. A similar threshold is correlated to the loss of motility in worms where toxic polyglutamine aggregation occurs in muscle cells. Another example can be found in the formation of yeast prion aggregates. Yeast aggregates exhibit a toxic aggregation threshold that is dependent on the concentration of the Hsp104 protein. In the biotechnology industry, bovine and human serum albumin exhibit an aggregation threshold that is dependent on a specific concentration of albumin.  Due to the importance of protein aggregation in both conformational diseases and the biotechnology industry, the underlying mechanisms of protein aggregation and their kinetic models have been studied for more than 50 years. These mechanisms often display differences in the interactions of key intermediates involved in the aggregation process. Existing models are typically used to discriminate protein aggregation mechanisms through assays. The existing mechanistic models cannot, however, explain the observed threshold phenomenon of protein aggregation. In chemical reactions the appearance of a threshold phenomenon is characterized by the presence of two stable steady states (and a third unstable steady state), which coexist within a certain range of parameters. In dynamical and complex systems, this phenomenon is known as bistability. In biochemistry, metabolic and signaling pathways exhibiting bistability will switch between the two stable steady states in response to a chemical signal. For this reason, it is generally said that such pathways exhibit 'switch‐like behavior'. In conformational diseases, the aggregation levels can switch between non‐toxic (low concentration) and toxic (high concentration) protein aggregates in a thresholddependent manner. To date, there are only a few mathematical models which can describe the threshold of protein aggregation in conformational or prion diseases as a bistable system. These models are phenomenological, however, and do not explain the threshold for protein aggregation in a mechanistic manner. Both theoretical and experimental evidence exists for bistable reaction networks in biology. Bistable networks have been extensively analyzed in a number of cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, cell differentiation, and cell death (or apoptosis). Biochemical switches have been observed in gene expression systems, such as the lac operon, sporlation inhibition operon, and oocyte maturation. Bistable switches are also implicated in stem cell fate decision and protein phosphorylation. Members of the complex systems community have focused on mapping and dissecting networks with the objective of discovering design principles that can explain complex behaviors. Recurrent network motifs have been linked to specific functions, such as temporal expression of gene networks, cell decision, biological oscillators, and biochemical adaptation. Some of the motifs involved in transcriptional and developmental networks are negative and positive auto‐regulation, feed‐forward loops, multi‐output, single input module, and dense overlapping regulons. These findings suggest that the functional repertoire of a network is determined by its topology (i.e., reaction mechanism). Therefore, it is reasonable to  Despite numerous studies characterizing the behavior of bistable networks, it is not known which specific network topologies will exhibit bistable behavior. There are three conditions generally considered necessary for bistability: (i) positive feedback loops, (ii) ultrasensitive stimulus‐response curves, and (iii) a mechanism to prevent a concentration explosion of any chemical species in the network. There is evidence in the literature to suggest that these may not be absolute requirements, however. In a review, Pomerening (2008,  , 381) addressed the fact that there is discordant evidence concerning both the design and function of bistable networks. Ortega et al. (2006,  , 3915) and Ramakrishnan & Bhalla (2008, No. 4) demonstrated that bistable switches can appear in networks with no positive feedback loops. In some enzyme‐catalyzed reactions, enzyme saturation plays a critical role, while in others the balance between competing reactions is at the source of the bistable behavior. To characterize bistability, one approach may be to search for bistable networks motifs in pathways, databases, or known aggregation reaction mechanisms. Neither KEGG nor BIOCARTA, two widely used databases of network interactions, report information on bistable behavior, however. In addition, no bistable behavior has been reported in existing kinetic mechanisms of protein aggregation. A computational exploration of random population networks with 8 molecules revealed that 2% of the mass action reaction networks exhibit bistable behavior. A different study began with a set of 12 biologically common reactions and performed a systematic exploration of all possible reaction configurations of (i) 1 to 6 reactions involving 2 or 3 molecules and (ii) 1 to 3 reactions involving 4 molecules. They reported that 10% of the reaction networks exhibited bistable behavior and discovered that autocatalysis is a good predictor of bistability. Interestingly, there is a correlation between prion diseases and autocatalysis. Unfortunately, autocatalysis is only a good predictor for networks with 3 molecules, which is not sufficient to describe the typical complexity of an aggregation reaction network. The primary objective of this project is to identify the chemical aggregation network topologies that give rise to bistability. The guiding hypothesis of our research is that as there are a limited number of network topologies capable of bistable behavior. To test this hypothesis, we will implement a set of complex systems based tools to discover the reaction topologies capable of exhibiting bistability. Specific aims: In this project, we hypothesize the existence of a limited number of topologies capable of producing bistability in aggregation reactions. If this hypothesis is correct, it should be possible to discover the essential motifs that are the basis of bistability and which are otherwise hidden by the complexity of the aggregation phenomenon. The characterization of bistability (motifs and conditions) in protein aggregation will be very important in the search of therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating conformational diseases. In addition, the discovery of essential motifs of bistability will help scientists organize network and pathway databases according to classification by key motifs in both naturally and non-naturally occurring aggregation reactions. We will validate the tools and methodology developed in this project by testing with a number of well-studied networks known to exhibit bistability. We intend to disseminate our methodology and the results of our research to the complex systems, computational biology, biochemistry, pharmacology, cellular biology and conformational disease communities. Finally, the research activities of this project will provide interdisciplinary (biological, physicochemical, mathematical, and computational) training to undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral researchers. The research activities will help train young scientists to apply complex systems approaches to an unconventional biological problem (the characterization of aggregation thresholds in conformational diseases).", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020223\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '413,487', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

And so, when students ask me about a career in research, I use an analogy to describe my own work: my colleagues, students, and I have been collecting pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle, and fitting them together bit by bit. We have found some of these pieces close to home in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology, and other pieces farther afield in areas such as comparative neuroanatomy, education, and public health. To understand the analogy above, a student would have to glean the abstract properties that are shared across two distinct content areas, including a part-to-whole relationship, and the idea of a large project that can be tackled bit by bit. This ability to jointly consider disparate sets of mental representations, known as , is central to human cognition, both because it supports learning and enables abstract thought. Indeed, it is relational reasoning itself - often measured with such tests as propositional analogies, transitive inference, and Raven's-like matrices tests - that I seek to understand: Although reasoning ability may seem too complex and multifaceted to gain much traction on at the level of brain mechanisms, it can be broken down into a set of component cognitive processes. Over the last decade, my colleagues and I have identified the neural underpinnings of several cognitive processes that support reasoning. Building on this research, we have examined the structural and functional brain changes that support improvements in relational reasoning over childhood and adolescence. We have also begun to identify the neural changes associated with reasoning training in young adults. Finally, working with children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, we have shown an average lO-point increase in non-verbal IQ after reasoning training. In our future work, we seek to (1) examine the effects on reasoning ability and academic achievement of focal brain lesions early in development, with a view to developing effective cognitive interventions, (2) use transcranial magnetic stimulation in adults to test whether the regions identified by our brain imaging research are necessary for relational reasoning, and (3) use new eye movement technology to better understand individual differences in reasoning ability, and to monitor improvements in reasoning over the course of training.

We learn new things from observing the world around us, and we learn new things from the testimony of others. Perhaps most remarkably of all, we sometimes learn new things simply by thinking. With ingenious thought experiments, Galileo concluded that all objects fall at the same rate, and Einstein argued that light bends in a gravitational field. Their insights were generated without the benefit of grants or graduate students or even laboratories. They were privy to no new empirical data, and had no external informants. They learned something genuinely new, and they did so simply by thinking. Thought experiments like Galileo's and Einstein's pose the puzzle of how knowledge can (seemingly) come from nowhere: How it is that thinking, in the absence of novel information from the external world, can generate new insights. This kind of learning highlights the exquisite power of the human mind, and challenges most existing theories of learning. An account of learning that can respond to this puzzle requires grappling with one of the hardest problems in human cognition: How our mental representations of the world are structured and change. Learning by thinking is not restricted to thought experiments in science --  it happens constantly in the course of everyday life. Consider the phenomenon of learning by explaining, in which one gains greater understanding as a result of explaining something to oneself or to others. Like thought experiments, explaining can foster novel insights in the absence of novel data from the external world. Mental simulation, deductive reasoning, and analogical reasoning are other ubiquitous processes that involve learning by thinking. By tackling conceptually challenging phenomena such as learning by thinking, my research addresses foundational questions about human cognition that shed light on the nature of mental representation and learning. My approach is interdisciplinary, combining the conceptual tools of philosophy and the experimental tools of cognitive psychology, with additional contributions from education and computer science. In past work, for example, I have drawn on philosophical theories of thought experiments and laboratory methods from cognitive and developmental psychology to address the role of explanation in learning. Other projects have examined the role of explanation in inference, causal reasoning, and social cognition, and have likewise benefited from an interdisciplinary approach. My current work engages the puzzle of how we seem to acquire knowledge from nowhere by examining a host of processes that involve learning by thinking, including learning from thought experiments, from analogies and analogical reasoning, and from fiction. The resulting analyses will lead us to a more complete picture of how people learn and form representations, with theoretical implications for the cognitive sciences and practical implications for education and artificial intelligence.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Berkeley', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020288\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

While treatments have improved, most patients will have to find ways to deal with their impairment for the rest of their lives. However, existing clinical tests are designed to diagnose the cause and progression of the disease, rather than to test the ability of the patient to compensate for their impairment and their rehabilitative potential. In particular, existing tests are predominantly based on visual acuity and perimetry, yet neither are very predictive of the patient’s everyday functioning. A new breakthrough is required to improve assessment of an individual’s chances of rehabilitation from vision loss. We hypothesize that the limited usefulness of existing tests for predicting impact and progress stems from the fact that those tests a) ignore important cognitive factors affecting visual information processing, and b) are static, while vision itself is highly dynamic. Specifically, at the cognitive level, several mechanisms determine whether observers can discriminate, attend to, and ultimately become aware of visual information. Moreover, in dealing with their functional limitations, patients are likely to develop compensatory eye and head movement strategies. We start from the premise that natural visual orienting behavior in realistic everyday environments will therefore provide a better reflection and prediction of everyday functioning. The primary aim of this project is to develop a standardized measure of real-world visual performance for people with vision impairment. We will combine virtual reality with eye and head tracking to develop an index of functional vision that can be obtained from natural, dynamic viewing behavior. We will do so by 1) developing suitable visual environments and tasks for a range of vision deficits; 2) develop eye and head tracking procedures (which is not trivial in cases of visual impairment), and 3) develop suitable models of how eye, head, and navigational movements combine in the visually impaired to predict everyday functioning and well-being. As an initial validation, we will test whether such models vary systematically depending on the type of vision loss, and whether they better predict athletic performance in a group of Paralympic athletes, as they are some of the best-known examples of people who have adapted to their impairment. The long-term practical goal is to provide clinicians with a tool to objectively assess the efficacy of real-world visual performance, from sensory to cognitive levels. At the shorter term, the project will deliver invaluable scientific impact by 1) developing suitable methodologies for measuring orienting behavior in the visually impaired, 2) validating existing scientific models of eye-head coordination that so far have been based on normally seeing populations, and 3) establishing a large publicly available corpus of orienting data in impaired populations for the scientific community to use.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3889', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The average 6-month-old human infant sleeps for a cumulative 16 hours of each 24-hour day. Yet, knowledge about the emergence of infants’ sensorimotor skills – uncontrolled sitting, crawling, reaching, walking – is more often informed by the smaller proportion of an infant’s day when they are awake. Furthermore, along the way to the mastery of new sensorimotor skills, which are typically documented in traditional laboratory tasks or parent reports, there are complex sensorimotor dynamics unfolding at fast, moment-to-moment timescales and occurring throughout all 24 hours of an infant’s day. The overarching aim of this proposal is to link infant sensorimotor dynamics during sleep periods to embodied sensorimotor experiences during real world awake periods to ultimately map a more comprehensive set of pathways of sensorimotor development. No studies to date have systematically integrated real-time movement dynamics during the sleep and awake periods of human infants and evaluated concurrent associations or predictive relationships. Studies of sensorimotor development have traditionally neglected integrating the sleep periods that account for a large proportion on an infant’s 24-hour day. Human infants spontaneously move around quite a lot during sleep periods and these movements are not random. Myoclonic twitches are discrete movements of facial features, arms, legs, hands, and feet that occur during sleep. The spatiotemporal dynamics of myoclonic twitches provide sensory feedback and support functional connectivity throughout the nervous system. It is therefore hypothesized that the sensorimotor dynamics of myoclonic twitches are functionally relevant for sensorimotor development and provide a foundation for more complex, specialized sensorimotor patterns and skills, what we call a sensorimotor cascade. In a prospective, longitudinal design, we propose to examine the roles that movement dynamics during sleep periods and sensorimotor behaviors during awake periods play in trajectories of sensorimotor development at 4, 6, and 8 months of age. First, we identify concurrent associations between spatiotemporal dynamics of movements during sleep and patterns of body movements and body positions during awake periods using novel wearable sensor technology and machine learning algorithms for body position classification. We then determine predictive associations between spatiotemporal dynamics of movements during sleep periods at 4 and 6 months with dynamics patterns of body positions during awake periods at 6 and 8 months, accordingly. Finally, we will examine how movement dynamics during sleep and awake periods provide a developmental landscape for the emergence of new sensorimotor skills like reaching and crawling. This proposal leverages the PI’s scientific expertise in quantifying the dynamics of behavior throughout multiple timescales of development, emerging wearable sensor technologies with rigorous computational applications, and a key team of collaborators to explore the relationships between dynamic movement patterns during sleep periods and profiles of naturalistic sensorimotor behaviors during awake periods.

Ideally, such measurements would simultaneously: 1) record rich data about multimodal experiences, 2) densely sample within a day and across days to capture variability in activities (e.g., errands, meals, play) over multiple timescales, 3) facilitate testing large, representative participant samples. Yet, no existing method satisfies all three criteria. Video observations in the home produce rich data, but are limited to a brief slice of time within a single day (usually while infants play). Day-long recording methods (wearable motion sensors, audio recorders) require specialized equipment, so are difficult to apply at scale. Daily diaries and surveys can broadly sample time and scale easily, but produce limited text response data. In this project, we will innovate a new method that employs caregiver-captured video to glean new insights about infants' everyday learning opportunities. We will apply the method to test new questions about how learning to walk alters infants' daily motor and object experiences. Leveraging the ubiquity of camera-enabled smartphones, we will prompt caregivers to take 5-s videos of their infants each hour of each day for two weeks (168 samples). We will apply a computer vision algorithm and train a machine learning classifier to automatically detect infant body position (upright, sitting, supine, and prone) from video to reduce the need for human coding of a large dataset. In Year 1, we will validate the new method in 13-month-old infants. Hand-coded body position annotations will train and test the machine learning model. The resulting body position categories will reveal how much time infants spend upright, prone, supine, and sitting in daily life, and how body position frequency differs between infants who have begun walking to those who have not. Crucially, time sampling within and across days will allow us to document day-to-day variability in body position. In Years 2 and 3, we will apply the method at scale to investigate how everyday experiences might mediate the link between walking and word learning via object experiences. Although recent work shows that infants who can walk have larger vocabularies compared to infants who cannot, it is unknown what aspect of walking facilitates this effect. We hypothesize that walking allows infants to acquire objects of interest and interact with them across a more diverse range of physical and activity contexts. To test this prediction, we will conduct a longitudinal video-survey study to measure infants' body position and object holding across the transition to walking. Openly sharing the method will provide a new tool for researchers to gather naturalistic data about a wide range of daily experiences. Sharing the corpus of caregiver-captured video will allow secondary data analysis and provide a benchmark dataset for testing new computer vision classifiers.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California at Riverside', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3803', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

You are focused on the  watermelon stand, at the far end of your  purview. However, while making  your way there, you have to filter out the pungent fish, assorted cuts of beef, spice racks, and  aromatic displays of breads and cheeses. In this crowded environment, you also mind your personal space but ignore the endless chatter of  throng of shoppers and  loud  shouts of merchants  advertising their goods, all of which are irrelevant to your present goal: picking a watermelon that  looks, weighs and sounds right1. Your ability to select the things you care about and ignore distractions is a crowning achievement of human cognition, called Attention. Most research on attention investigates how sensory responses are affected by attention and  thus  takes into account the organizing principles of  the brain areas devoted to  each  sensory  modality.  In the visual system, investigations often emphasize the effect of spatial attention on  topographically organized cortices.  These principles have been useful when studying attentional modulation of perception  within a given  modality.  However, emphasizing principles unique to  different brain systems may  limit our accounts of mechanisms that coordinate  information  processing in  different brain systems,  a primary role for attention. My lab uses a  variety of approaches (psychophysics, physiology,  eye tracking,  and  individual differences) to  describe the temporal structure of attention in different domains.  We hypothesize that temporal  properties of attention form an organizing,  domain-general, principle. In recent studies[1, 2],  I have shown that  a rhythmic temporal structure guides  attention in the  visual spatial domain.  The cognitive system  samples relevant objects at a rate of eight times a  second (8 Hz). When attention is distributed  between two competing objects, each of these  objects  is sampled in alternation, four times a second.  I labeled this phenomenon “attentional  sampling”.  My research program seeks to uncover domain-general principles that govern and  coordinate the guidance of attention. The  discovery of attentional sampling in vision provides a  paradigm for investigating  domain-general attentional sampling within and between modalities which my group will pursue in the coming years. Systems neuroscience research has shown that rhythmic  temporal structure in neural responses promotes and organizes communication between  brain regions. In an analogous manner to  the efforts of understanding coordinated neural responses [3],  I investigate how attentional sampling  provides a  domain-general code for  coordinating cognitive functions engaging different systems.  Uncovering  this code will provide a  connection between  attention at the  market place and attention in the lab. In addition to shedding light on  the way that attentional  processes unfold in healthy individuals, this research program will also contribute to our  understanding of pathologies impacting attention (e.g., attention disorder deficits, hemi-spatial  neglect) and inform interventions inspired by the unraveled architecture of attention.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The Hebrew University of Jerusalem', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020465\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Microscopic images reveal that while some of these bacteria live as solitary cells, most  live within multi-species aggregates of hundreds  to thousands of cells. These aggregates can be  conceptualized as the “condominiums” of  the microbial city, with the valleys between epidermal cells as the  main traffic arteries. A plethora of microbial interactions occur in this metropolis: Some compete for food or  territory, some produce food for others, some give others a ride, and some produce toxins to attack others.  These interactions, together with the microscale spatial heterogeneity of the leaf surface as a microbial  habitat and the spatial constraints, are key to the  organization of these “microbopoli” on the leaf surface. A thought-provoking experiment is conducted by nature billions of times every day, when new leaves  emerge and are colonized by microbes. As in human  cities, leaves are first colonized by early settlers,  followed by immigrants. Strikingly, in each such experiment, the community converges to a characteristic  community composition with precise non-random spatial organization that is plant specific. The leaf  surface’s physical, chemical, and biological properties render the robust community assembly even more  puzzling. This is because leaf microbes live not in a  liquid environment, but rather on a surface that is  typically dry, constituting a serious limitation to transportation. How can  we explain this repeatable self-organization of these complex communities? What are  the underlying design principles that allow such  robust self-organization? Research in my lab centers on the phyllosphere – the  above-ground parts of plants – which is dominated by  plant leaves. Plant leaves offer an excellent model  ecosystem for studying microbial ecology and the  principles that govern complex communities’ self-organization on biotic surfaces. The phyllosphere is  important, as these microbial populations are essential  to plant health, growth, and function, while only a  minor portion occasionally causes disease. The phyllosphere is a huge habitat: Earth’s total leaf surface area  is about twice that of its land area. The total microbial phyllosphere population is vast (10^26 cells), as is its  impact on global biogeochemical cycles. My group is conducting an integrative study using systems-biology approaches combining theory,  mathematical models, and computer simulations (e.g., individual-based simulations) with lab experiments  and field sample analyses, while fully optimizing  the latest research technologies such as single-cell  genomics and advanced fluorescence microscopy.

But converting retinal input into rich object-centric scene descriptions, or sound waves into words and sentences, are major computational challenges. The crux of the problem is that the natural axes of low-level sensory input spaces (e.g. retinal photoreceptor or auditory hair-cell potentials) are misaligned with the axes along which behaviorally-relevant constructs vary. In vision, for example, object translation, rotation, motion in depth, deformation, re-lighting, etc. cause complex non-linear changes in image space. Conversely, images of two objects that are functionally quite distinct, e.g. different individuals' faces, can be very close together as pixel maps. Behaviorally-relevant dimensions are thus \"tangled up\" in this input space, and brains must accomplish the extremely computationally-demanding task of untangling. My goal as a computational neuroscientist is to reverse engineer the brain's sensory systems with enough fidelity to build formal computational models that: Underlying these goals is the hypothesis that advances in psychologically-informed AI will lead to better neural models; and conversely, better understanding of the brain will push the boundaries of AI. My belief in this fruitful reciprocity is inspired by significant recent progress in understanding neural response patterns in higher visual and auditory cortex. In this work, optimizing deep neural networks for performance on simple but ecologically relevant sensory recognition tasks (e.g. visual object categorization or auditory speaker identification) has led to quantitatively accurate models of neural response patterns in higher cortical areas that were previously inaccessible to quantitative understanding. Conversely, observed neuroanatomical hierarchical structure and physiological retinotopy of the visual system (and related findings in audition) helped inspire the class of deep convolutional neural network algorithms currently revolutionizing computer vision and other areas of artificial intelligence. My research program focuses on two related problems that build on this work, capturing what I feel are key open directions in creating behaviorally richer and more neurally accurate models of visual cognition. One focus is on discovering more psychologically realistic learning rules | understanding the dynamic principles behind how sensory systems flexibly incorporate data in the environment to improve their functioning.

In many ways, this idea sparked a centuries-long debate on how external  sensory inputs and internal neural computations combine to generate cognition. With the  development of new technologies and theories in the years after Locke’s proposal, what was  once fodder only for philosophers, would become the topic of rigorous scientific  study.  In the  1800’s,  physician-scientist  Ramon y Cajal  would lay pen to the delicate branching structures of  neurons and propose that individual  brain cells compose the mind.  Much later,  experimentalist  BF  Skinner would champion the  argument that stimuli reign, with sensory inputs and their  effects driving  all behavior. And with the  rise of artificial intelligence and computer science in the  21st century, the dialogue would be pulled back towards determining the intrinsic components  that  generate cognition. These efforts led to critical insights on how  external sensory inputs are processed, with research  illuminating how sensory stimuli are represented  by  in the cortex and identified as a particular  sound, sight or smell.   But the complexity inherent to internal cognitive processes, such as  thought or recollection,  left deducing the cells and circuits that implement such phenomena a  daunting prospect. Over the last few decades however,  the  tractable response properties  of parahippocampal neurons has  provided a new access key to the neural signatures of  two cognitive processes:  self-localization and  memory. Defined by functionally discrete response  properties, neurons in the parahippocampus are proposed to support memory  and navigation  by  generating an internal  neural  map of space. Medial entorhinal  (MEC)  grid cells provide the  neural metric of this map, encoding distance traveled by firing in multiple, regularly spaced  locations. The neural metric for orientation is provided by head direction cells, while border cells  code the location of environmental boundaries. My research focuses on leveraging this system to understand how external sensory inputs meld  with internal computations to generate neural codes capable of supporting  spatial  cognition.  Here, we propose a research program  aimed at shifting the dialogue on the mechanisms  underlying self-localization and memory. First, we  plan to leverage computational and statistical  methods to develop new theories on how MEC neurons represent space, support navigation  and provide the building blocks for encoding  spatial memories.

This seemingly straight-forward cognitive act guides the unfolding of simple social interactions such as the decision to approach or avoid another person as well as more complex forms of cooperation and joint action. How do we know that someone else is experiencing an emotion? What is the nature of the signal? Traditionally, scientists and lay people have believed that emotions are conveyed—perhaps universally—by the contraction of specific facial muscles that together comprise what are usually called facial expressions of emotion. The belief in specific facial expressions of emotion is foundational to research in scientific disciplines spanning affective and cognitive science to computer vision and artificial intelligence. But recently some theorists have claimed that the high variability in the form of facial expressions and the fact that their interpretation can be influenced by context indicates that reliable and generalizable facial expressions of internal states of emotion do not exist. Both the traditional view and critics of it, however, rely on conclusions drawn from decades of research that tended to involve (1) very small datasets containing (2) still images of (3) posed (i.e., not spontaneous) facial expressions (4) made in the absence of a perceiver or other audience, and displayed by (5) White actors. The proposed research constitutes a response to the limitations of previous research on the types of facial expressions that occur in the real world, by diverse populations, and how they are recognized by perceivers. The research steps include the (1) creation of an initial dataset of facial expressions displayed in emotion-eliciting dyadic tasks, (2) innovative modeling of resulting facial features, (3) analysis of categories of expressions, (4) creation of an “in-the-wild” dataset with the use of wearable devices from a diverse population of individuals, (5) comparison of initial models on the new dataset, and (6) evaluation of perceivers’ categorizations of instances of the discovered facial expression categories. Findings will have important implications for models of the signaling and recognition of emotion. In addition, results will have fundamental implications for the use of emotion in legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, educational practices and the commercial applications used in all of these activities, most notably, so-called facial expression recognition software. Facial expression recognition software is based on fundamentally flawed prior research and yet is used for everything from assessing people’s preferences for products evaluated in marketing campaigns to the likely performance of players in teams associated the National Basketball Association.

Research has investigated the profound effects of early differences in language input on later development, but significantly less attention has been devoted to the critical question of why differences emerge in the first place. In contrast to existing research that often focuses on characterizing differences between the input provided by parents of higher- vs. lower-socioeconomic status (SES), our goal is to understand the day-to-day circumstances influencing parents’ behavior in low-SES settings and to explore the realities and consequences of families’ experiences with financial insecurity. Specifically, our proposed research aims to investigate how real-life difficulties faced by parents living in poverty – in particular,  cognitive demands imposed by continuously having to worry about insufficient resources – can affect interactions with their children and impede the language input they are otherwise able to provide. Our project will address three primary aims. First, we will test the hypothesis that financial concerns capture the attention of parents in low-SES settings and interfere with the quantity and quality of communicative input that they can provide for their children. Using naturalistic recordings from the home, we will test whether being asked to contemplate financial challenges leads parents to speak to their children less during everyday interactions. Data from a pilot study (n=22) suggest that lab-induced attention to financial challenges affects communication with children in subsequent minutes, but this study was limited by constraints inherent in controlled lab experiments. Second, our research will broaden our understanding of the challenges that different families face by studying participants from two communities that are vastly underrepresented in contemporary research: Latinx families in El Paso, TX, and African American families in Trenton, NJ. Children from low-SES families in both communities are at-risk for difficulties with language and school, and almost no existing research offers comparisons between these racially/ethnically underrepresented communities, which will be critical to developing effective and culturally-sensitive interventions for supporting children from vulnerable populations. Finally, we will explore how fluctuations in parents’ speech relate to financial concerns over time. We will collect daylong recordings from the same families at two different age points: 18 months, and one year later, at 30 months. Moreover, at each age, we will collect data at the beginning of the month (when finances are most likely to be secure) and at the end of the month (when money is most likely to be scarce). This longitudinal design will allow us to explore fluctuations in parents’ speech across different timescales (from minutes to weeks to months) and to test relations between the speech that low-SES children hear and current levels of financial insecurity in the home. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand how real-life challenges, including the persistent need to manage financial concerns, may intrude on parents’ interactions with their children across multiple communities. Better understanding of such contributors may inform interventions and policies designed to reduce early and long-lasting effects of poverty on parental speech and their children’s development.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas at El Paso', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2021-3135', 'year': '2021', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Over the last 20 years, the scientific field of event cognition has seen dramatic growth in explaining how the mind and brain deal with brief, simple everyday events. A major catalyst has been the ability to present complex video, text and VR stimuli while measuring behavior and brain activity. We have already seen payoffs in clinical science and information technology. However, event cognition research is still largely locked in the lab, where we can only study \"nano-events\" such as words, pictures, and sentences, or at best \"micro-events\" such as short movies or curated interactions. To make the next qualitative jump forward will require getting out of the lab and developing techniques that allow researchers to record what people actually do and how they think about it over ecologically meaningful temporal extents. That is what we propose to do here. The rise of smartphones, online services, and the internet of things make this the right time to tackle human event comprehension and memory at the scale of our lived experience. In this proposal, we will take advantage of these developments to study event cognition in the wild. Over the last 10 years, Professor Simon Dennis and his collaborators have been developing an infrastructure for helping people record cues as they live their lives that can help them personally to enrich their personal memories, and also form the basis for new discoveries about memory (see www.unforgettable.me). Unforgettable is capable of collecting over 600 sources of information, including time, location (GPS coordinates and place names), people (generated from emails, SMS and phone calls), activities (accelerometry 8-15 times a second continuously plus labels from activity recognition classifiers), images, sounds, language (email and SMSs), weather, and self-reported emotions. Unforgettable Research Services has a pool of 2700 participants - some of whom have been collecting these sources continuously for the last four years. In this project, Zacks, Dennis, and their team will use these existing data along with new data we will collect to build and stress-test computational models of event comprehension and memory that embrace the complexity and scale of real life. This project is uniquely suited to the JMSF call. It embraces complexity by taking on the full range of everyday activity situated in real work (and play) context. It recognizes the dynamic nature of action by explicitly tracking the multidimensional interactivity of naturally occurring activity. It unites previously separate domains of activity by merging data from live behavior (sound and picture recordings, GPS) with data from the increasingly essential virtual dimensions of our lives (email, SMS). By doing so, we will unite the traditionally separated domains of psychology, ethology, big data, and human-technology interaction. The events that matter in our lives are too big and too complicated to fit within a laboratory session.

Feelings of physical fatigue are common across many everyday contexts, and can have significant consequences for health, wellbeing and performance. In research on the neurobiology, physiology, and psychology of physical activity, fatigue is increasingly studied as something that originates not just in peripheral bodily systems, but as a brain-derived emotion that dynamically and adaptively regulates behaviour. As such, fatigue in physical activity is not just an event of the embodied brain, but also of the environment that integrates cognition and emotion, top-down predictions and bottom-up sensory information, and internal and external worlds. As a focus of study,  fatigue therefore has enormous potential to advance our contemporary understanding of human cognition and behaviour in context. Like other subjectively experienced, adaptive homeostatic systems (e.g., pain), fatigue is subject to many powerful environmental influences, including social cues of safety and support. Although positive effects of perceived social support on fatigue have been reported, existing studies in constrained laboratory conditions and with limited sample diversity risk overgeneralising the results. Understanding fatigue as a developmental process between brain, body, social, physical and cultural environment, the proposed research will examine how the buffering effects of social support on fatigue systematically vary according to individuals’ experiences of early and later life social adversity or advantage, and according to individuals’ expectations about social context effects on fatigue. Through a series of field experimental studies in real world physical activity settings, we will quantify effects of early life history, social context and prior expectations on physiological, behavioural and psychological markers of fatigue. The research will generate new data and lines of enquiry on fatigue processing with relevance to exercise, occupational and health contexts. It will situate the interdisciplinary study of fatigue, and dynamic homeostatic regulation more generally,  within a novel interdisciplinary synthesis of social, evolutionary and developmental factors, providing a foundation for future research on this complex and important phenomenon.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Oxford', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2020-1152', 'year': '2020', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These assumptions are important and undergird between-person studies of inter-individual variation that allow researchers to generalize findings to populations and clinicians to apply intake assessments to eventual treatment. Unfortunately, these assumptions have also arguably led to misconceptions surrounding how individuals think and solve problems in their day-to-day lives because – more often than not – people are unique and their cognition waxes and wanes with their daily experiences. This observation motivates the over-arching question of the proposed project: How do contextual influences on cognition vary across individuals on a day-to-day basis? The goal of this project is to answer this question in the domain of executive function (i.e., inhibition and working memory, as well as processing speed, which underlies them). Laboratory-based studies suggest that executive function can vary significantly across days, and that it is impacted by daily health, stress, and affect (especially for older adults), but it is unclear how these processes play out for individuals in ecologically-valid, real-world settings. Therefore, within-person ambulatory assessment investigations of intra-individual variation in executive function are sorely needed. Such investigations involve the collection of many data points from the same individuals in the contexts of their everyday lives, and have the potential to leverage heterogeneity across people and time in order to generate personalized inferences. Thus, the proposed project will determine the person-specificity of day-to-day variation in executive function and its relation to daily experiences, and it will examine how those relations shift over time for a dynamic adult population. This will be accomplished in a 100-day ambulatory assessment study of 300 adults, ranging from 18 to 80 years old. Aims of the study are to: (1) generate and validate novel 100-occasion measures of inhibition, working memory, and processing speed that can be completed on any Internet-capable device; (2) create person-specific network models of daily predictors of executive function variation, focusing on physical health, stress, and affect; and (3) examine the dynamics of personalized executive function networks across adulthood and aging. The general hypothesis is that executive function fluctuates across days in concert with daily experiences, but in different ways for different people, especially across age. This project is innovative and ambitious, but it is also feasible because it triangulates methodologies from other fields in order to answer a pressing cognitive science question. It modernizes executive function assessment by moving research out of the laboratory and into the “real world,” and it generalizes neuroscience dynamic network modeling to daily cognitive and behavioral data – all while taking a personalized approach, consistent with trends in education and medicine.

For instance, a neuron may fire only when its input neurons fire simultaneously, and the\nelectrical grid may crash only when demands of multiple users become synchronized, producing total-usage spikes.\nOnly synchronous components of signals matter in the average signal that affects the next hierarchical level. Complex ecosystems are of this type. Ecosystems include multiple trophic levels, with population-dynamical\nsignals from lower levels often being spatially aggregated to affect higher levels and human concerns such as fisheries\nand agriculture. For instance, predators are only harmed if prey populations are simultaneously low over a whole\nhunting area. And human fish exploitation is only reduced if fish populations decline synchronously over all accessible\nfishing locations. Thus spatial synchrony of population dynamics is crucially important to ecosystem dynamics. Population synchrony is widely observed and studied. Correlations between population time series from different\nlocations are seen in organisms as diverse as mammals and protists, at distances up to thousands of kilometers. Synchrony is related to large-scale outbreaks and shortages. Causes of synchrony include dispersal between\npopulations, and, crucially, synchronized climatic drivers. In spite of the importance of synchrony, impacts on synchrony of global climate change are virtually unstudied.\nClimate change will worsen, and much research has already documented the ecological impacts of climate change,\nincluding poleward species range shifts and phenological changes. But historic difficulties in determining specific\nclimatic drivers of population synchrony have prevented research on possible impacts climate change could have\non synchrony if it modifies those drivers. Climate change constitutes not just warming, but also changes in other\naspects of environmental signals. Synchrony can also be transmitted through trophic interactions, e.g., a\nsynchronized predator can induce synchrony in its prey. The extent to which climate-induced changes in\nsynchrony may cascade through complex interaction networks is unknown. My lab recently developed new ways to help identify environmental drivers of synchrony, and we showed that\nchanges in drivers occur, and can have important population impacts at large spatial scales. For instance,\nchanges in winter temperature synchrony caused changes in the synchrony of aphid pest populations which influence\nagriculture across Britain. We also have and continue to develop new techniques and models for understanding the\ntransmission of synchrony through trophic networks. We will therefore explore the important question: My research approach has several components: 1) new statistical methods using wavelet transforms;\n2) analysis of multidecadal, multispecies, insect, plankton, fish, and environmental datasets from European and\nNorth American sampling programs; 3) mathematical models and stochastic process theory in a network context;\nand 4) analysis of climate scenario data from global circulation models.

As these fields have developed as quantitative disciplines this question\nhas been generalized to include a range of quantitative patterns of biodiversity—known as macroecological\npatterns. Examples of these patterns include quantitative measures of the balance of rare and abundant\nspecies in a given community, and the turnover in species composition across space. What is surprising\nabout these phenomena is that they have been observed to display similar forms across many disparate\necological systems, from microbial communities to tropical forests, leading ecologists to wonder whether\nthe great complexity of natural systems can be mapped onto a smaller set of ecological ‘rules’ for these\nemergent patterns. If this assertion is true, it has implications for our understanding of emergent phenomena\nacross a range of complex systems, and also very practical implications for modeling and predicting\nbiodiversity patterns—predictions derived from understanding how these systems work will be critical to\nconserving biodiversity and ecosystem health. My research centers around this question of what rules really govern ecological dynamics and my goal is to\naddress this using a biological version of the renormalization group. The renormalization group is a set of\nideas drawn from physics to understand coarse-grained phenomena, and it teaches us two critical lessons.\nFirst, that at coarse-grained scales, the behavior of many different models ‘flows’ to the same universality\nclass; second, that the special models defining these universality classes have fewer degrees of freedom\nthan might be expected. For example, liquid-gas and ferromagnetic phase transitions seem very different,\nand yet both are governed by the same universality class, with essentially just one parameter to tune near\nthat transition. My recent work has focused on the evolutionary history of a group of organisms, known as phylogenetic\ndiversity, and it sets the scene for an ecological renormalization group. We have found that empirical\nphylogenetic trees have relatively simple, universal backbone structures at coarse-grained scales. This\nis very much reminiscent of a renormalization group flow, and I plan to build on this work to develop an\nunderstanding of how ecological and evolutionary processes coarse-grain onto models of lower complexity.\nIn summary: 1. We will gain an underpinning for ecologists’ intuition that large-scale phenomena are emergent, governed\nby simpler coarse-grained models that nevertheless drive empirical phenomena. 2. We will lay the groundwork for a methodology to make predictions for complex ecological systems,\nknowing which processes are critical in developing predictive models that scale up from small-scale\nprocesses to large-scale predictions. 3. We will develop insight into emergent patterns in non-biological complex systems, including the dynamics\nof social and financial systems. In these systems, heterogeneity, interactions and adaptation\nare ubiquitous, and aggregated outputs are often analogous to macroecological patterns.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Illinois', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020439\\n', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The formation of complex structures and the evolution of\ncomputationally complex dynamics are considered emergent if the overall\nbehavior of the system is difficult to derive, calculate, or intuit based on the\ncomponent parts. This emergence typically results from interactions such that the\nwhole is other than the sum of its parts. This raises the questions: What are the parts, and how do we sum them? More\nprecisely, can parts be defined at multiple levels, and do some levels better\ncorrespond to the emergent behavior of the whole? For instance, in searching for\nindivisible parts of matter, physicists have looked further and further down to\nquarks and potentially strings. In contrast, in the search for emergence, we are\nled to looking at higher levels, and perhaps collections of objects or the\ninteractions themselves are best understood as the parts. Here, I focus on\ninteractions among drugs and among consumers as specific systems to gain\ntraction on these questions. Great progress in understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems\nhas been achieved by combining network theory with dynamical systems theory.\nMuch of network theory is founded on pairwise interactions. Typically, even when\nconsidering collections of multiple nodes (objects) and edges (interactions), each\nedge is defined by the presence of a pairwise interaction. Nevertheless, some\ninteractions may only emerge when three or more objects are present, even\nthough no interaction exists between each isolated pair. More generally, an\ninteraction among multiple objects may be due to the sum of its pairwise parts, or\nmay only emerge when all objects are considered together. Standard network\nrepresentations do not make these distinctions or have symbols that capture\nthese higher-order, emergent interactions. Moreover, standard interaction metrics\neither assume the interactions are the sum of the pairwise parts or measure the\ntotal interaction without distinguishing pairwise from emergent contributions. Here, I outline a plan for addressing these limitations and for tackling the\nquestions above. I suggest directions for novel theory that are tied to\nexperiments and grounded in empirical results. I propose metrics for measuring\nemergent interactions and a general mathematical framework for defining these\nemergent metrics relative to many notions of interaction—additivity, covariance,\nmutual information. I present data that show emergent interactions are common\namong drugs being used to kill microbes. I argue for similar patterns among\nconsumers and resources. These emergent interactions exhibit some salient and\nsystematic features, such as higher degrees of antagonism. Understanding these\nfeatures could lead to the development of better tools for aggregating\ncomponents and interactions in complex networks. Exploiting these systematic\npatterns and how they change in frequency and magnitude across levels of\nemergence could also provide clues to novel methods for taming the \ncombinatorial complexity that is usually viewed as the Gordian knot of higher-order\ninteractions.

Shares in companies such as Qualcomm were offering traders returns of almost 2,600% in a year. Many Wall Street leaders saw how this would end. Julian Robertson, manager of the Tiger hedge fund, steadfastly refused to buy into the bubble. Because of this stance his fund lost money and investors throughout 1999, and was forced to close in March of 2000, just as the bubble burst and technology stocks began to tumble. This example serves to highlight some of the general principles and processes that govern the behavior of complex systems. Exogenous factors invoke a response from individuals, interactions then magnify, or inhibit, this behavior and a collective response emerges. The loop is closed as the collective behavior creates pressures on the individuals, effectively altering their environment. Potentially the collective will dominate external factors and the best option for individuals (temporarily at least) is to follow the herd, regardless of their own beliefs or opinions. Throughout the natural world this dynamic may be observed. Animal groups are a classic example of a complex system in which individuals must reconcile personal objectives with their social context. Here, as in finance, it is often better to be wrong than alone. In these systems there is an interplay between leadership, social interaction, and environmental information that determines the accuracy of collective decisions. In the context of movement, and in particular the long-range movements associated with migration, animals have the potential to improve their navigational accuracy by traveling together. However, the use of social information may also have negative consequences. Behavior that was adaptive in one situation may be fatal when the structure of the social group changes. Further, evolution may drive systems to suboptimal states, as free-riders gain an advantage and parasitize information. Hence, long-range animal movement is often a multi-level process in which individuals aggregate, collective behavior emerges, and conformity abounds. The purpose of this research is to explore these themes in a range of migrating animals. Four study systems will be investigated; wildebeest of the Serengeti, caribou of northern Canada, salmon in the Pacific Northwest, and bar-headed geese on their migration across the Mongolian Steppe. By employing state-of-the-art robotics and computer vision software, the trajectories of animals will be recorded as they make their journeys. Analytical tools will be used to assess the role of sociality in movement decisions and investigate leadership roles, the effect of environmental cues, and the consequences of traveling in a group. In this way a taxonomy of collective movement will be created. This will be used to investigate the feedback between the collective and the individual, with the aim of understanding the role of social influence, and its impacts on the stability and robustness of these migrations.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Exeter', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020441\\n', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Recent studies of the dynamics of human agglomeration using the framework of scaling analysis demonstrate that there is great utility in conceptualizing human societies in terms of the aggregate properties of social and infrastructural networks. Through a combination of painstaking empirical work and the application of ideas from complex systems, a theoretical framework is emerging that derives many aggregate properties of modern cities from first principles and yields predictions that have been borne out in a large number of empirical tests. This theory builds from basic properties of all human networks in providing an explanation for the observed elasticities in many quantities with respect to urban populations. The result is a view of cities as built environments that sustain greater degrees of connectivity and faster rates of social interaction, thus enhancing the division of labor and increasing innovation rates and productivity, but also rates of crime and disease. We seek to generalize and test these ideas on a wider range of societies as a step in building a general theory of human societies as complex systems. Three points argue that our program of research on the scaling of human agglomerations in is worthwhile and feasible, but also challenging. First, the parameters of emerging theory do not invoke specific characteristics of capitalism, industrialization or democracy, but instead focus on generic properties of all human networks. As a result, urban scaling models, suitably-modified, may apply broadly to human aggregations across time and space. Second, initial analyses of archaeological data support the hypothesis that scaling phenomena occur in a wide range of human systems, and the exercise has also proven to be theoretically-productive. Third, we have found that appropriate data for scaling analysis are difficult to obtain for many pre-modern systems for a variety of reasons. In short, a historical and comparative perspective on settlement scaling is crucial for continued development of this framework, but accomplishing this goal will require significant additional investment. We are therefore engaged in an integrated program of research that involves: 1) the generalization of urban scaling theory to encompass all forms of human agglomeration in the past and present; and 2) compilation and analysis of archaeological and historical data from systems that are useful for probing details and exposing blind spots in the theory. Theoretically, we focus on the determinants of the pre-factors of scaling relations, factors that define the limits of settlement populations, and the extent to which scaling effects are realized in systems with slower aggregation rhythms than are typical of modern systems. Empirically, we focus on compilation and analysis of data from Ancient Greece and Rome, Medieval Europe, Mesoamerica, the Andean region, and native North America. In this way, we will build a more encompassing settlement scaling theory that sheds new light on the evolution of social complexity.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020438\\n', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Neonates produce primarily cries and short, quiet non-cry vocalizations. By 3 months, infants typically have expanded their repertoires significantly, exploring pitch, amplitude, and vocal quality. They also often produce some very primitive pre-consonant sounds, although those are usually not produced with precise articulation at this age. At 6 months, many but not all children have begun producing at least one well-formed (precisely timed) consonant-vowel sequence (such as “ba” or “muh”) on a regular basis. At 9 months, almost all typically developing children produce well-formed (canonical) syllables, and many produce multiple different consonant and vowel types. By 12 months, many children produce at least one or two recognizable words with consistent meaning associated to the sound. My research seeks to document how this dramatic vocal learning unfolds and to understand the neural, social, and physical mechanisms involved. Our work involves both research with human participants and building computational models. On the human side, my work focuses on utilizing long-form audio recordings of children’s vocalizations and auditory environments, collected “in the wild”. Some key findings to date are that infant and adult vocalizations tend to be hierarchically clustered over the course of a day; adult responses to infant vocalizations tend to be contingent on the type of vocalization a child made; and small differences in vocalization quantity and in adult response patterns appear to lead to larger differences in developmental trajectories of demographic and clinical groups. Currently, I am leading an effort to analyze infant vocalization as process of foraging in acoustic space. We are borrowing methods used to study animal foraging in space and adult human foraging in memory, which are in turn borrowed from work in physics studying particle diffusion. My lab also has human listeners label events of interest within daylong home audio recordings, to ask questions that currently cannot be addressed using automated methods, and we are also working to build automated methods that produce more accurate and more specific labels. On the computational modeling side, my collaborators and I simulate how neural, mechanical, and social mechanisms jointly contribute to infant’s vocal learning. A main finding from this line of work is that reward-modulated Hebbian learning coupled may play an important role in infants’ learning. Computational modeling is particularly important in studies of speech development because of the great difficulty in obtaining information about the state of the nervous system as infants perform tasks and because of the major limitations on what types of experimental manipulations can be performed on human infant participants. My work in this domain helps to bridge our understanding of neural function from invasive animal studies with studies of human communication. Furthermore, understanding infant vocal development provides information critical to understand how the human speech capacity evolved, and simulation provides a powerful tool to ask questions about human vocal evolution.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Los Angeles', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020507\\n', 'year': '2017', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Yet, these children who astonish us with their effortless language learning continuously forget where they leave their coats and hats. This fundamental puzzle guides my research program: How do children learn language so rapidly even though their memories, attentional control, and information processing systems are still developing? My work aims to resolve this puzzle by modeling language acquisition as a coordination problem between children and their caregivers. The problem to understand is not how children learn language, but how children and their caregivers construct it together. Children are inundated with language from a variety of sources from parents to conversations between family members to the television in their living rooms. However, research shows that the speech that matters most is the speech directed to children by their caregivers. Infant-directed speech differs systematically from the speech that adults produce to each-other: Pitch contours are more pronounced, sentences are shorter, and repetitions are more frequent. Infants not only prefer to listen to child-directed speech, they learn better from it. Why do we talk this way to infants even if we are not intending to teach them? My research program explores the hypothesis that the pressure to maintain a child’s attention and communicate successfully results in supportive linguistic input. Even if we just want a child to stop crying, or to wipe their nose, we need to tell them in a way they understand – a way that must be coordinated to their individual cognitive and linguistic development. Together, these many moments of coordination add up to language learning. My research program investigates this coordination from both directions, analyzing the basic cognitive processes that children bring to language learning as well as the way that caregivers structure information for their developing learners. (1) The first line of my work studies how children’s developing attentional and information processing systems control the information they have available to learn from. (2) The second line of my work examines the representations and algorithms that children bring to bear on this to discover the meanings of words. (3) The third line of my work characterizes the natural ecological contexts in which language acquisition occurs, showing how coordination between learner and environment lead to the right kind of information becoming salient for the attentional system and ultimately learning. (4) Finally, the newest work in my lab is developing a framework for studying language acquisition in interaction, probing the child’s active role in structuring the communicative exchanges in which language learning happens. The goal of this work is an understanding of both why language acquisition is typically so rapid, and why it is sometimes delayed. Successes (and failures) of learning must emerge from the coordination between cognitive constraints and learning environment.

Indeed, when faced with the approach of a slithering snake or a dangerous drop-off, delays in responding can be costly, perhaps even deadly. But how do we learn what is safe and what is dangerous? How do we detect and respond to potential threats—dangerous animals, aggressive people, infectious diseases—in the world around us? Because of the significant reproductive benefit associated with rapid identification of threatening stimuli, the most prominent theories propose that humans have evolved psychological mechanisms that facilitate the detection and subsequent avoidance of potential threat. These mechanisms are thought to detect cues in the environment that signal the presence of threat, and initiate cognitive and emotional responses that lead to avoidance behavior. For example, researchers have proposed that humans possess an evolved fear module that is activated upon contact with recurrent, widespread, and evolutionarily relevant threats like snakes, spiders, and threatening conspecifics; activation of this module is automatic, and leads to rapid detection and rapid fear learning for threatening stimuli (Öhman & Mineka, 2001, 2003). Behavioral immune system theory proposes that a similar set of mechanisms evolved to detect the presence of pathogens or infectious illness, automatically activating disgust responses that result in avoidance behavior (e.g., Murray & Schaller, 2016; Oaten, Stevenson, & Case, 2011; Schaller & Park, 2011). Although these and other similar theories differ in their specifics, they all assume that humans possess a specialized set of mechanisms for threat detection and avoidance that are universal, early emerging, and stable across individuals. However, until recently, no developmental research had addressed this topic. My research program investigates human behavioral responses to emotionally valenced stimuli—specifically to negative or threatening stimuli—and the mechanisms guiding the development of these responses. In one line of research, I found that humans perceive the presence of threatening stimuli very quickly, and that rapid detection begins in infancy. However, these biases can be learned, they can change over the course of development, and may reflect a broad spectrum of individual differences. Further, in a second line of research, I found that avoidance responses to threats do not develop until later in childhood, and are dependent on learning. My current work builds on these findings to ask whether early perceptual biases for threat contribute to maladaptive avoidance behaviors, such as those associated with the development of fear and anxiety, and how children learn adaptive avoidance responses, such as avoidance of contagious people or contaminated objects. Altogether, my findings suggest that human threat responses are not singular or automatic: They are differential and complex, supporting flexible developmental trajectories based on both experience and context. By continuing to develop procedures that measure threat responses developmentally, and by establishing the developmental time course of these behaviors, I hope to create a broader theoretical framework for understanding how early developing biases for threat interact with everyday experience to create both adaptive and maladaptive patterns of responding.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020504', 'year': '2017', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These systems are characterized by the presence of\r\ndifferent levels of self-organization, each of which determines the behavior of the next. One of\r\nthe most important properties of complex systems is the impossibility to predict their overall\r\nbehavior from the knowledge of their individual properties or as if they were isolated system's\r\ncomponents. Understanding and predicting the behavior of these systems is of great importance\r\nin contexts as diverse as socio-economic, biological or technological fields. The Science of\r\nComplex Systems not only provides a way to answer open questions, but also promotes a new\r\nlanguage and the introduction of concepts that will allow the tackling of many current and\r\npressing problems. One way to address the problem of complexity in such systems is by studying their structure\r\nand function. During the last decade, important discoveries show that there is a common pattern\r\nof self-organization that emerges over and over again in different complex systems. Somehow,\r\nthe interactions between system elements (species, individuals, genes, proteins, routers) that occur\r\nin real systems (physical, biological, social and communication) give rise to networks that\r\nshare a large number of common features. These are the so-called ''complex networks\". Complex\r\nnetwork theory is particularly advantageous to explore several aspects of complexity. The\r\nfundamental goals of network science are: to describe the structure of interactions between the\r\ncomponents, and to assess the emergent behaviour of many-body systems coupled to the underlying\r\nstructure. Advances on this theory will improve our understanding and modeling capabilities\r\nso that we may control or predict the dynamics and function of complex networked systems.\r\nIn addition, this approach does not rely on a detailed knowledge of the system's components\r\nand therefore allows universal results to be obtained that can be generalized with relative ease\r\n(e.g., the study of epidemic spreading processes is equivalent to the spread of computer viruses).\r\nFor example, biological networks like protein interaction networks share many structural (scale freeness)\r\nand dynamical (functional modules) features with other seemingly different systems\r\nsuch as the Internet and interaction patterns in social systems. Thus, systems as diverse as peer-to-peer networks, neural systems, socio-technical phenomena or complex biological networks\r\ncan be studied within a general unified theoretical and computational framework. Although outstanding results have already been obtained in this research field, we have\r\nnot yet progressed enough in basic theoretical aspects and in the application of the generated\r\nknowledge to the characterization and exploitation of real multi-level time varying complex\r\nsystems. Moreover, with the unprecedented amount of data at our disposal nowadays, new\r\nchallenges arise. Even if the datasets are inherently incomplete and noisy, recent analyses show\r\nthat most of the current tools are becoming rapidly outdated and are not powerful enough to deal\r\nwith the complexity of many systems. Current tools fail to keep up with the shifting challenges\r\nthat complex Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems pose. For instance,\r\nthink of a techno-social system like online social networks in which individuals engage in a\r\nmultitude of categorical (politics, science, sports, technology, etc) layers, giving to each of them\r\na specific weight. Could we predict or simply understand how likely it is that a given rumor,\r\nidea, or belief reaches system-wide proportions? Is there a general mechanism behind such\r\nkinds of social contagion or are there different mechanisms unique to each categorical level?\r\nAre influential individuals globally defined or instead level dependent? Can we understand what gives rise to social uproar as recently witnessed? We believe that the only way to answer the aforementioned kind of questions is to explicitly\r\ndeal with the multi-level nature of complex networked systems. However, almost all of the work\r\nto date is based on an 'ordinary\" 1-layer or simplex view of the networks in question, where\r\nevery edge (link) is of the same type and consequently considered at the same temporal and\r\ntopological scale. Generally speaking, the description of networks so far has been developed\r\nusing a snapshot of the connectivity (a projection), this connectivity being a reflection of instantaneous\r\ninteractions or accumulated interactions in a certain time window. This description\r\nis limiting when trying to understand the intricate variability of real complex systems, which\r\ncontain many different time scales and coexisting structural patterns forming the real network\r\nof interactions. For example, P2P networks are constantly changing, with some of the connections\r\nhaving a very short lifetime, while others are persistent. Interest groups are constantly\r\nbeing developed and growing, and individual nodes participate through different interests at the\r\nsame time. An accurate description of such complexity should take into account these differences\r\nof interactions and their evolution through time. In the last couple of years, the scientific\r\ncommunity on networks theory has focused on this issue and proposed a solution that has been\r\ncommonly referred to as the multiplex network structure. A Multiplex network has a variety of different connection types between the nodes of the\r\nnetwork. For example, a Facebook user is connected to her Facebook friends through the Facebook\r\nnetwork, but she may also be connected to the same people (nodes) through follower\r\nrelationships in Twitter. In order to understand the structure of the person's true social neighborhood,\r\nit is necessary not only to determine the people to whom she is connected, but also\r\nto account for the different types of connection (e.g. undirected in Facebook, directed in Twitter)\r\nthat exist. Networks arising in other applications can also change dynamically in time and\r\ncontain different types of edges. For example, people have different communication and contact\r\npatterns depending on the specific circle (family, work, leisure) they currently reside in, or\r\nsimply when they are traveling or ill. All the previous questions and challenges clearly call for an important foundational and\r\nmethodological transformation of network science. A new framework is required which will\r\naccommodate current -- and future -- theoretical and algorithmic needs. To this end, we will\r\nadopt a radically new idea: to build a mathematical formalism based on rank-four tensors instead\r\nof on adjacency matrices to represent and analyze the most general class of networks, i.e.,\r\nmultiplex networks. This will allow generalizing all existing metrics, algorithms and theoretical\r\ntools from ''simple\" networks to time-varying, inter-dependent (i.e. ''multiplex\") networks. In\r\ndoing this, we will both generate new mathematical models, and test and validate these models\r\non real data. In this project, we therefore aim at developing a comprehensive theoretical foundation for\r\nstudying the structure of multiplex networks, and dynamics that run on these networks. We\r\nwill generate a general theory, capable of unifying the scattered approaches that currently exist\r\nfor multiplex network structure, and including these as special cases. We will also develop\r\nnovel approaches for several types of dynamics on multiplex networks, focusing on analytically\r\ntractable cases where the impact of the multiplex nature (in contrast to an ordinary network\r\nprojection) of real networks has important dynamical effects. Our theoretical approaches will\r\nbe validated using multiplex social network data.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Universitat Rovira i Virgili', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020325\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Sound is created when events in the world cause air molecules to\r\nvibrate, and takes the form of pressure waves that propagate through the air. Our auditory\r\nsystem measures sound with two sensors (the ears) that register the vibrations of the ear drums\r\nback and forth in response to sound.

Cognitive control is an ill‐defined term, but generally refers to the ability to direct our behavior at our goals. A\r\nlongstanding question concerns the driving force behind such goal‐directed behavior. What motivates us to exert cognitive\r\ncontrol? Why are some people driven by the least bit of stimulation, while others have difficulty getting off the\r\ncouch for almost anything? The goals that guide our behavior can be defined at different levels and are organized hierarchically:\r\nmotivational goals (e.g., ‘maximize reward’ or ‘minimize punishment’) and cognitive goals (e.g. ‘complete taskset\r\nx’). Ultimately, adequate cognitive control requires, among other things, the transformation of information\r\nabout motivational goals into abstract cognitive goals. Both motivation and cognitive control have received extensive attention. Accumulating evidence indicates\r\nthat they both implicate brain circuitry connecting the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. These brain regions\r\nare highly sensitive to modulation by the ascending neuromodulator dopamine. However, surprisingly little is\r\nknown, at either psychological or neural level, about the interaction between motivation and cognitive\r\ncontrol: Ongoing and\r\nfuture work in my group focuses on this interaction between, on the one hand, motivational control, and on\r\nthe other hand, cognitive control. In folk psychological terms, being motivated implies being goal‐driven. Accordingly, one might intuit that\r\nmotivation just has beneficial consequences for our ability to direct our behavior at our cognitive goals. In line\r\nwith this intuition, appetitive motivation – the state triggered by external stimuli that have rewarding\r\nproperties ‐ has been argued to have general, nonspecific enhancing effects on cognition. However,\r\nrecent evidence indicates that motivation does not enhance all cognitive processes in a nonspecific manner\r\nand can in fact impair some cognitive processes. For example we have argued that appetitive motivation,\r\nwhich is known to implicate changes in dopaminergic activity, has functionally selective consequences for\r\ncognitive control. This suggestion stems from our own and others’ previous insights that (i) changes in\r\nappetitive motivation are accompanied by changes in dopamine, and (ii) dopamine has contrasting effects\r\non cognitive control depending on current task demands and associated neural systems. Ongoing and\r\nfuture experiments on motivation in my group leverage knowledge about the relationships between\r\ndopamine and cognitive control, as well as that between dopamine and motivation, and are grounded in .

This question has puzzled ecologists and evolutionary biologists for decades because the competitive exclusion principle tells us that two ecologically similar species should compete so strongly that one is necessarily driven extinct. In an attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction, two somewhat unsatisfying frameworks have been proposed. First is the \"neutral theory of biodiversity\", which posits that species are indistinguishable, and that the dramatic differences in empirical species' frequencies can be explained by demographic noise. Despite the great power of this theory to fit data, most ecologists feel that the model is pathological in that no two species - let alone all species - are indistinguishable. Second is a set of \"niche partitioning\" theories in which species are driven to develop unique niche requirements (e.g. set of resources, predators, pathogens). The fact that species' growth can be limited by a finite number of factors makes the coexistence of very many species highly improbable in this framework. Here, we propose a new perspective that both embraces competitive exclusion yet explains the impressive biodiversity that surrounds us. Our model is fashioned after the children's game of \"rock-paper-scissors\", with each \"strategy\" designating a single species. Rocks exclude scissors when competing in isolation, scissors exclude papers and papers exclude rocks. In a system such as this, all three species can coexist indefinitely given their \"intransitive\" (i.e. non-hierarchical) set of interactions. The simple \"rock-paper-scissor\" system has been intensively studied, as it finds applications in a variety of fields including biology, economics and psychology. Practically no attention, however, has been paid to the many-species case. We will develop methods merging graph theory, game theory and dynamical systems to provide analytical results for a large set of interacting components. Analytic results include the number of coexisting species and their frequencies. We will then test our ability to predict community composition based on the result of pairwise competition experiments, as well as our ability to infer competitive interactions based on an analysis of empirical frequencies at stationarity. We can build a network (technically, a tournament) in which we draw a connection from species A to species B (nodes of the network) whenever B excludes A in isolation. Repeating the process for all pairs of species generates a tournament. This network can be mapped in a game-theoretical framework in the following way: two players simultaneously and independently select a species in the tournament (according to each player's \"strategy\"). The player that picks the winner in pair-wise competition gets one point, while the other player loses one point. What are the optimal strategies for the two players? It turns out that this simple zero-sum (one player gains one point while the other player loses one point), symmetric (the two players are exchangeable) game has only one optimal solution (strategy), and that this strategy is the same for both players. We prove that this solution is also the expected frequency of the species composing a tournament when competing in a well-mixed environment. Using this mapping between the pairwise competitive outcomes and the game theoretical result, we can easily solve for the expected frequencies of all species at equilibrium. These results are empirically testable. For example, we can take a given number of species, perform all the possible pairwise competition experiments, and then use these outcomes to predict the community composition when all the species are competing against each other. We can also adopt the inverse approach and, given the distribution of species' densities, infer which tournament best explains the observed community structure. We present preliminary results supporting the claim that the theory can predict species distributions that are compatible with those observed in nature. Clearly, testing the predictions of our model would be quite challenging when the species in question are vascular plants or animals, as the experimental complexity would be overwhelming. We propose, therefore, to use bacterial communities as they provide diverse yet tractable experimental systems. Bacteria offer several advantages, including small size, rapid generation time, and the development of high-throughput robotic methods that allow analysis of temporal dynamics with ample replication of communities. Moreover, we can control environmental conditions, paving the way to sensitivity analysis that can inform us about the generality of the results. We will focus in particular on a set of bacteria commonly associated with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This is a fascinating community of bacteria that includes species with diverse lifestyles and with clear evidence of interspecific competition (both through resource competition and through the production of toxins) between them. We will perform pairwise experiments to determine the competitive ability of each species of bacteria, recording the density of the two species through time. We will then move to assemblages of the same species, again determining relative densities through time. Our ability to obtain precise time-series on complex communities opens the possibility of testing theories not only at the stationary state, but also far from equilibrium. This should facilitate major advances in that all published theories to date have been developed with a static endpoint in mind. Indeed, the protracted debates on community diversity, as well as the associated statistical models, have centered on concepts such as stability and stationarity: species reach \"equilibrium\" so that their relative frequencies do not change over time. Despite the fact that this simplifies the mathematical treatment, it is clear that most of the ecological action happens during the transient dynamics phase. Extinction, for example, does not wait for equilibrium to be achieved but is an ongoing process throughout community establishment. Robust statistical techniques can be used to infer the parameters of dynamic models based on time series data. In particle filtering, we have a model for the dynamical system of interest (in this case a model expressing how competition among species evolves in time) and an observation model (i.e. a model describing observations in time). The time series of species' densities can be then used to infer parameter values and the likelihood of any model-dataset couple. In this way, models that predict similar endpoints can be still be assigned very diffrent likelihoods, whenever their dynamics are different. We believe that this novel approach to model selection will bring new ideas and more statistical power to the field. Our simple theory of biodiversity could be extended in several ways. One of the most promising is to make the outcome of competition stochastic rather than deterministic. For example, one could imagine a framework in which species A excludes B with probability p. The simple \"rock-paper-scissors\" game that we outline above corresponds to the case in which p is either 1 or 0 (i.e. one species always wins). Another natural case to study is that in which p = 0,5: this is exactly the neutral case. As such, the theory outlined here and the neutral theory of biodiversity can be viewed as two extremes of a spectrum of competitive hierarchies. By varying values for p, we can mimic spatial heterogeneity, seasonal variations in the competitive abilities, etc., making the theory more biologically grounded. The theory proposed here has applications that go far beyond ecology. In fact, the same type of equation has been used to study other complex networks of competing agents, such as in population genetics (i.e. frequency of alleles in a population), economics (i.e. competition among firms), evolutionary dynamics (evolutionary game theory), and psychology (formation of \"social traps\"). In general, whenever there is competition among several subjects and the presence of complex trade-offs, we expect similar dynamics to arise. Our goal is to develop a theoretical framework that is grounded in its application to ecological theory, yet flexible enough to provide insights and tools relevant to a diverse range of fields.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Chicago', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020231\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '449,817', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The senses provide the brain with pitch, volume, lines, curves, shading and color. The brain not only analyzes and categorizes these complex, often ambiguous inputs as spoken and written words, objects, and faces, but, remarkably, seems to immediately and effortlessly link them with a rich array of knowledge that is experienced as the \"meaning\" of those perceptual events. At the broadest level, my research program examines the cognitive and neural dynamics that make such rapid comprehension possible. Studies using patient and imaging data to localize functions in the brain have catalogued a broad set of areas associated with subcomponent features of meaning - e.g., the shapes, textures, sounds, functions, and associations that make up the concept denoted by a word. Yet meaning is experienced as unified. How this distributed information comes to be bound together to yield a coherent, conceptual level representation remains a mystery at the very heart of an understanding of human language and thought. Our emerging data suggest that meaning is not \"looked up\" in memory, as traditionally thought, but is instead dynamically constructed - and that time serves as a critical binding force. What information becomes part of the meaning of an input critically depends on when information becomes available. Thus, as we have shown, meaning is context-dependent, colored by expectations, and subject to individual differences. The critical role of processing dynamics in shaping meaning construction is strikingly attested by hemispheric differences. The left and right cerebral hemispheres share the same basic anatomy and physiology and perform most basic cognitive functions in parallel. Yet, we have argued, they differ in the efficacy of their feedback connections, and, as we have documented, this has critical consequences for how each recognizes and remembers words, comprehends the meaning and structure of sentences, and deals with ambiguity and errors. My research program thus goes beyond the study of individual cognitive subprocesses and the use of localization-biased cognitive neuroscience approaches. Instead, we investigate how processing unfolds over time as well as space, within and across the two hemispheres, and over a broad range of input types and tasks. To that end, we take advantage of the temporal and functional specificity of event-related brain potentials, which we are beginning to combine with techniques that allow perturbations of processing dynamics, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (and computational modeling), as well as new techniques that provide concurrent temporal and spatial precision, such as event-related optical signal data, which has not yet been used extensively to study comprehension. We also examine how those mechanisms and the dynamics of their interactions differ across individuals and change with age, with a focus on how factors such as timing, memory, recruitment of specialized neurocognitive resources, and anatomical and genetic variability affect the real-time construction and revision of meaning. In the long-term, we expect this approach will highlight novel kinds of factors and interventions that can protect against or alleviate functional decline across the lifespan.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020234\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Episodic memory is a fundamental faculty that supports mundane yet crucial abilities such as finding one's keys or one's way home, as well as more complex functions such as knowledge acquisition (De Haan, in press), the development of autobiographical memory (Nelson & Fivush, 2004) and continuity of self (Buckner & Carroll, 2007). Given the centrality of episodic memory for the human experience, it is not surprising that scientists and philosophers have been long fascinated with questions such as: How do we remember our past in such detail? How do we represent events in space and time? What function is served by the subjective feeling of vividness evoked by recollecting the past? These questions have also motivated my own research, which focuses on the development of episodic memory in childhood. One might assume that by the time children reach school age, their experience of the world depends on episodic memory as much as that of adults--children constantly surprise their parents with recollections of minute details about their daily lives--but, in reality, a great deal of change in memory functioning occurs during childhood. How do we explain this change? We now know that at least two classes of processes support adult episodic memory. allow us create, store, and later reinstate representations (\"bound\" representations) that integrate information about an event with the constellation of contextual features surrounding it. allow us to initiate operations, such as strategies and assessments of current mental states, that guide the formation and retrieval of bound representations. The prevailing view is that binding processes develop early, and memory development in childhood is driven entirely by changes in controlled processes. However, my research on both typical and atypical development suggests that the alternative view, that binding processes also continue to develop, has been prematurely dismissed. Understanding developmental changes in these processes is crucial for a comprehensive theory of episodic memory. My research aims to: (1) elucidate the development of episodic memory by teasing apart the contributions of binding and controlled processes during childhood; (2) examine whether these processes can be enhanced through training interventions; and (3) understand how the disruption of these processes (e.g., in neurologically impaired populations) alters their developmental trajectory. In light of these goals, I will review some of the key behavioral and neuroscientific research that has led to our current understanding of the building blocks of episodic memory, identify critical questions that remain, and propose new approaches to address them.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Davis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020241\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

With an emphasis on the transition between individuals and social groups, research in my lab seeks to address the causes and consequences of these evolutionary transitions. Areas of interest include (a) multilevel selection, (b) causes and consequences of social evolution, and (c) the ecology and evolution of metapopulations. We use a variety of research tools, including fieldwork in temperate and tropical areas, computer simulation, analytical modelling, and laboratory work employing cytological and molecular techniques. Central to our empirical studies and a source of inspiration for our theoretical work are the social spiders, a phylogenetically diverse set of species that have converged in evolving cooperative behaviour and highly subdivided population structures. Because colonies of these organisms constitute not only social groups, but also self-sustaining populations, they are ideally suited to address some fundamental and often controversial issues at the intersection of ecology and evolution. Much of my life's work has involved the exploration of traits for which selection at multiple levels may be in conflict, such as sex ratios in subdivided populations and cooperation in social groups. My dissertation work at Harvard University (Ph.D. 1992) was a combination of empirical and theoretical research into one of the most hotly debated issues in evolutionary biology-whether selection at the level of groups can be an effective evolutionary force. At a time when the idea of group selection was viewed with hostility, I showed that social spiders represent a largely unequivocal natural example of this form of selection. By means of computer simulations, I showed that their highly female-biased sex ratios represent a compromise of selection acting within and among their more or less permanently isolated colony lineages. This and more recent work on the evolution of cooperation in single-generation groups of non-relatives demonstrate that there are general principles underlying multilevel selection processes that should apply to a broad range of population structures and to traits as varied as sex ratios, cooperation, pathogen virulence, and cancer. In a synthesis paper in preparation I show how these principles, derived from Darwin's four postulates of evolution by natural selection, can be used to test for the presence of selection at any level, either in our conceptual models or in our empirical systems. Philosophically, I argue that the levels of selection problem is not one of prediction, but one of causality: while models built from the bottom up or the top down can often be used interchangeably to correctly predict the expected evolutionary outcome, there should be only one answer to the question of whether one, two, or more levels are involved in yielding a particular equilibrium state. Based on the empirical finding that individual fitness often has a \"humped\" nonlinear relationship with colony size, I have developed a framework for the study of social evolution that uses the shape and magnitude of this function to make predictions about the origin, size, and dynamics of social groups. While subsuming complex ecological interactions in a simple three-parameter model of the relationship between average individual fitness and colony size, this approach brings to the study of sociality the theory and methods of nonlinear dynamics while representing a radically different, albeit complementary, approach to the existing paradigm -Hamilton's inclusive fitness framework- that has dominated the field for the last few decades. Three projects illustrate the value of this approach: - I have shown, for instance, that the enhanced reproductive success that results from cooperation may allow the colonization of harsh or marginal environments in which solitary individuals would not be able to replace themselves. In contrast, in environments in which group living and cooperation allow access to plentiful resources, enhanced reproductive success may lead to a boom and bust pattern of group and population growth. The former situation is dramatically illustrated by the existence of eusocial mole rats in the extremely arid deserts of southern Africa; the latter, by the oscillations in colony size of some social spiders and the global population outbreaks and crashes of tent caterpillars, voles, migratory locusts, and tree-killing bark beetles. - Using agent-based simulation models I have extended this general framework to provide a solution to one of the enduring problems in social evolution-the maintenance of cooperation in the presence of freeloaders. I have found that even though freeloaders can benefit from cooperators when rare, they are selected against when common due to the reduced productivity of the groups they overburden with their presence. This effect allows the evolution and maintenance of cooperation under a wide range of parameter values, even when groups consist of non-relatives and cooperators suffer a relative fitness cost within their groups. These models provide the testable prediction that freeloader frequencies will oscillate through time and is consistent with the widespread occurrence of helping behaviour among nonrelatives in human and many animal societies. - I have also used agent-based models to explore the interaction between ecology, demography, and kinship in social evolution. I have shown, for instance, that the decision to admit nonkin into groups has not only genetic, but also demographic consequences- while restricting groups to close kin facilitates the evolution of altruism, it may limit groups to suboptimal sizes; admitting nonkin, on the other hand, allows the formation of groups of any size, but limits the evolution of altruism. I have also shown that the random assignment of helping roles within groups breaks this trade-off, thus allowing the evolution of highly altruistic behaviours in groups of nonrelatives of any size. A major contribution of my work has been to pioneer the use of social spiders as model systems for a variety of important and controversial issues in ecology and evolution, discovering in the process 6 of the 21 species known to the world. In addition to showing that their highly female biased sex ratios may represent the workings of interdemic (= intercolony) selection (see above), I have used them to explore the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic factors in social evolution, the short and long term consequences of inbreeding, and, as proposed in this project, the interplay between local and global dynamics in metapopulations. - Work from my lab in this area illustrates, as in perhaps no other social system to date, how sociality arises from the interaction between intrinsic features of organisms and the environments in which they live. We have shown, for instance, that social species in the genus Anelosimus, whose colonies contain from hundreds to tens of thousands of spiders, are restricted to the wet low to mid-elevation tropical areas of the New World, while the single-family groups of related subsocial species predominate at higher elevations and latitudes. We postulate that this pattern reflects an interaction between the dense three-dimensional webs characteristic of these spiders with two separate environmental gradients, one of insect size, which we have shown decreases with elevation and latitude, the other of the intensity of precipitation and abundance of potential ant predators, which we have shown exhibits the opposite trend. - One of the extraordinary features of spider sociality is its association with strong inbreeding as members of both sexes remain within their natal nests to mate generation after generation. My students and I have investigated the fitness consequences potentially associated with the origin of such inbred systems, including the costs and benefits of remaining in the natal group in social species, of dispersing in subsocial species, and of producing inbred offspring in ancestral-like outbred subsocial species made to artificially inbreed. These findings allow us to quantitatively show that the origin of inbred spider sociality was probably an easier transition than previously believed, thus explaining the repeated origins of this social system. Based on its spindly phylogenetic distribution, however, we also show that inbred spider sociality may in the long run constitute an evolutionary dead end. Our research has been highlighted in Trends in Ecology and Evolution (1987, 1992), Science News (1999), Science Editor's Choice (2007), and Nature News online (2008). It has also been the subject of three TV documentaries (Scientific American Frontiers, USA 1999; The Desert Speaks, USA 1999; La Televisión, Ecuador 1997) and a radio interview (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation \"Quirks and Quarks, Oct 2002). The models on cooperation and nonlinear dynamics were highlighted by James T. Costa in his recent book \"The Other Insect Societies\" (Harvard U Press, 2006), in a chapter entitled \"Back to the Future.\" Our work on spider sociality has been transformative of the field.

Current therapies can result in better survival but generally leave patients with severe life-long neuro-developmental handicap. Targeted molecular therapeutics holds great promise for the development of less toxic and more effective personalized treatment strategies for cancer (1). This approach, however, requires a detailed understanding of the molecular alterations that drive tumor formation and malignant progression. The identification of driving mutations in cancer can be used to inform the development of therapeutic agents that specifically inhibit the protein products and pathways that are deregulated due to cancer-associated gene alterations. This strategy has been used successfully in adult brain cancer, leading to clinical trials that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), for example. Pediatric malignant astrocytomas (PMAs) in children, however, are distinct clinical entities from those seen in adults and do not harbor many of the critical genetic alterations found in their adult counterparts (2-5). PMAs are the leading cause of cancer-related death from solid tumors in children. Because of their invasive nature, PMAs are surgically incurable, and standard chemotherapies have been only modestly, and transiently effective in their treatment. Most patients succumb to their disease within 12 months of diagnosis. In recent years, a potential link has emerged between neural progenitor (stem) cell populations and the origin of astrocytomas. This concept is central to a major objective of this proposal: to identify the type of cell that gives rise to PMAs. It is possible that further insights into the biology of neural stem cells could provide insights into the genesis as well as treatment of these tumors. Until recently, analyses of pediatric malignant astrocytoma DNA had revealed little regarding the genetic etiology of these tumors, and consequently little was known regarding potential therapeutic targets for their treatment. However, a research effort led by UCSF investigators, including Drs. Rowitch and James, published earlier this year, provided important new insights regarding key PMA gene alterations. We have shown that an activating mutation of the BRAF oncogene is prevalent in PMAs (Schiffman et al., . The mutation, called , results in deregulated and heightened enzymatic activity of the BRAF protein (7). In a series of 31 PMAs we found a 23% incidence of this mutation. This observation further highlights the genetic differences between PMAs and their adult counterparts, in which BRAF mutations seldom occur. Interestingly, in five of the seven PMAs identified as having the mutation, there were additional alterations resulting in gene inactivation, and associated loss of expression of a key protein that acts as a regulator of cell growth, p16. Our results suggest the possibility that the combination of activation and inactivation confers malignant character to astrocytes in children, and cause PMA development. BRAF is a member of a cancer-associated signaling pathway, and there are several BRAF signaling pathway inhibitors that are currently in clinical trials for treating other types of human cancer. These include inhibitors of MAPK, a key downstream effector of BRAF, as well as BRAF itself. Consequently, the observation of mutations in PMAs provides a rationale for testing BRAF pathway inhibitors in appropriate pre-clinical models for PMA. Tumor cells lacking , and that do not express p16, also have an approachable therapeutic target: the cdk4 protein, whose activity is heightened in tumors lacking expression of p16. Therefore, our recently published observations highlight at least two therapeutic strategies for treating PMAs. Until recently, the genetic underpinnings of pediatric astrocytoma have been obscure. New findings indicate that activating mutations in association with inactivating mutations of the tumor suppressor locus occur in as much as 20% of pediatric astrocytomas grades II-IV. This project will generate genetically faithful mouse models of this type of brain cancer. Resultant tumors will be analyzed with the help of the UCSF brain tumor research center neuropathology core. The Core is also performing detailed analysis of human pediatric astrocytomas in our cohort, with similar markers to those we propose to use in the mouse tumors. Our analysis of patient PMAs will provide information allowing validation of our mouse models. Such models, as well as human malignant astrocytoma xenografts, can immediately be used for preclinical testing of RAS/BRAF/MEK inhibitors that have been developed for blockade of this pathway in cancer treatment. Such small molecule antagonists have been used to treat other cancers, such as melanoma. Thus, there are compelling reasons to rapidly generate mouse models with these aims in mind. The current application will utilize existing information and resources for developing mouse models to better understand the cellular origin of -associated PMAs, and adapt -/- tumor cells for utilization in therapeutic test models.

This is particularly true in cellular tissues in which single cells are organized into multi-cellular tissues which are further assembled into complex organs. Central to the proper behavior in these biological systems is a cross-level interdependence. To date, limited studies of signaling in multicellular networks have demonstrated that the architecture of multi-cellular systems can have a significant impact on the behavior of individual cells as well as their emerging collective behavior. From, emerging properties and functions of multicellular structures to health and structural reorganization of tissues, architecture-dependent signals serve as pathways to transmit information that encodes the cues and regulates the working of the constitutive elements (e.g. cells, groups of cells). Over the past decade, questions concerning the interactions between cells and their environment/architecture have received increasing attention from tumorigenesis, to tissue engineering to angiogenesis. For instance, there is strong evidence that the branching architecture of the mammary gland and associated cellular signaling are major regulators of epithelial cell function [1,2] or disregulation [3]. The disfunction of interactions between the genome, metabolism, and tissue can impact the probability of cancer [4,5] and a normal organ architecture can suppress tumor formation and prevent malignant phenotypes even in grossly abnormal cells [6]. Tissue engineering in its attempt to construct functional tissues faces the challenge of arranging cells (e.g. scaffolding via decellularization of allograph tissue) in a three-dimensional configuration with an architecture analogous to the native tissue, that supports molecular signals with the spatial and temporal characteristics that can sustain appropriate development and function [7-9]. Also, downstream and upstream signal conduction between endothelial cells along the walls of vessels is playing an important role in circulatory function of formed vasculatures, vascular network remodeling, vasculogenesis and neovascularisation [10]. A particularly relevant aspect is the emerging behavior of a multicellular architecture in which celllevel functions, such as intracellular pathways, integrate with multicellular architectures through cellto- cell interactions. Central to this problem is that cellular networks inherently combine dynamical and structural complexity. Early progress on modeling coupled dynamical systems was limited to spaceindependent coupling or regular network topologies. Further progress to circumvent the difficulty associated with the combined complexity of the dynamics and of the architecture was achieved by taking a complementary approach where the dynamics of the network nodes is set aside and the emphasis is placed on the complexity of the network architecture [11]. These models have had great impact on network science and relevance across numerous disciplines ranging from physical sciences, to social sciences to computer science and life sciences. Yet despite the tremendous progresses in network science, there is a risk in explaining the biology of multicellular architecture from a purely network point of view without considering the complexity of the intracellular pathways occurring at the network nodes. Specifically, we are still lacking a fundamental framework for understanding the integration of lower-order activity (e.g. cell signaling) with higher-order, multicellular architecture to produce a multilevel description of biological organization and function in tissues. Furthermore, most experiments describe the impact of one level on another and not the key aspects of the important regulatory loops, central dynamical features. Moreover, in studies where some insight into the role a single molecule might play across multiple orders or levels (e.g. knockout mouse studies), there remains a paucity of conceptual models that fully integrate the highly dynamic and complex nature of many-ordered biological systems. From a theoretical perspective, Othmer and Scriven [12] developed, following Turing's pioneering mathematical treatise of morphogenesis [13], an analysis technique in which the information about the underlying network topology, through a connectivity matrix, is decoupled from that of the intracellular reaction pathway mechanism, thus enabling progress in multicellular network research that includes complexity at both low and high levels. In a series of studies [14,15], our research led us to use the Green's function-based Interface Response Theory (IRT) [16], a method originally developed for tackling composite media in condensed matter physics, to augment Scriven-Othmer's method to solve coupled dynamical networks with nontrivial connectivity matrices and therefore integrate natural biological organization from the cellular level to complex network architectures. We used this approach to calculate analytically the spectrum of propagating compositional waves in models of multicellular architectures and to study putative signal conduction dynamics across networks of endothelial cells. Compositional waves originating from simulated intracellular Ca2+ and inositol triphosphate (IP3) negative feedback loops in endothelial cells were shown to be shaped by the connection topologies of networks. Considering models of networks constituted of a main chain of endothelial cells and multiple side chains in ordered, defected, or disordered topologies; we showed that transmission spectra of compositional waves encode architectural information separately in terms of spatial arrangement and branch length via scattering and resonant filtering, respectively. This discovery has striking implications on the role of calcium signaling on cross-level interdependence in multicellular architectures in terms of signal generation and decoding. For example, the generation of architecture-dependent signaling necessitates cellular control over calcium and IP3 self-regulation as well as control over oscillation frequency via calcium regulation of IP3 concentration. On the other hand, decoding of structural information by individual cells would also need cellular control on frequency dependent intracellular pathways such as frequency-dependent protein phosphorylation by a Ca2+ -calmodulin activated kinase which was shown to be ubiquitous in wide variety of cell types [17]. Therefore, it seems more likely that our calcium-based frequencyencoded wave-like signaling is operative in a range of multicellular architectures and tissues. For instance in the transformation of preformed vasculatures, vessel branching would tend to reinforce cellular response by positional order potentially leading to additional regularity in the architecture. As the spatial extent of the architecture is strongly influenced by the reaction for key cellular compounds, the same mechanisms could be applied in many biological structures such as various organs, muscles, connective tissues or the nervous system. These implications highlight the need for careful research on the effects of long-range conductive signals emerging from cross-level interactions that may play a role in the function and development of multicellular architectures. They also highlight the growing need for the combined development of theoretical and experimental research approaches that can describe the dynamical response at the cellular level of complex multicellular structures. The problem of extracting dynamical data on calcium-based signaling in natural biological tissues is a difficult one due to the uncontrollable nature of the architecture, due to the presence of extracellular matrix and to its variable cellular composition. Without a means for testing the predictions of theoretical models in the form of controlled experiments there is little hope to make significant progress in shedding light on the cross-level interactions leading to architecture-dependent signaling. Decoupled experiment and theoretical research have little chance of establish a clear picture of this emerging paradigm. This proposal focuses on the development of a new approach with complementary integration of theoretical and experimental methods for studying the cross-level interactions in multicellular architectures and their effect on collective dynamic behavior. The intent is to produce calcium-based cross-level protocols that exist in biological systems, describe new types of higher-order behaviors arising from lower-order phenomena, and make predictions concerning the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of multi-order biological systems. The theoretical approach to be used focuses on the exploration of the linear and non-linear behavior of calcium-based signaling in model networks of endothelial cells through Green's function IRT methodologies. This research will also pioneer the use of microengineered geometrically-constrained networks of endothelial cells to serve as platforms to arbitrate the theoretical predictions in terms of the effect of network topology on the spatiotemporal characteristics of emerging calcium signals. Geometrically unconstrained networks patterned by a direct-write tissue printing tool will be used to interrogate single cell response as well as the response of entire networks (such as remodeling) to structure-dependent signals. This joint approach will profoundly impact the field of cross-level interdependence in multicellular networks as there have not been previously methods for correlating reliably and systematically theoretical predictions with experimental observations in homologous model networks. The proposed research focuses on the study of prototypical networks of nearly one-dimensional chains of endothelial cells. The success of this joint experimental and theoretical work will lead to unambiguous understanding of cross-level signaling that could not be studied in less controllable tissues. The proposed methods will allow us to identify the effects of structural features on the dynamics of the cellular networks and separate spectral characteristics of the complex behavior of the dynamical networks resulting from organizational (scattering) and structural (resonances) processes. Our goal is to develop a new model-based theoretical and experimental framework to shed light on the poorly understood phenomenon of cross-level interactions in complex and dynamic multicellular structures. While there is considerable amount of knowledge on the behavior of individual cells, there is only a beginning of recognition that the unit of function in higher organisms is not the individual cell, but the tissue itself. Indeed, tissue architecture and/or microenvironment influence lower-order biology at the intracellular level and vice versa. The proposed research leverages progresses in modeling of the dynamics of complex network system, progresses in microengineering of multicellular structures and tissue engineering to develop the necessary approaches to understanding multicellular architecture and the procedures that govern the transmission of information between its cellular constitutive elements.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Arizona', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020222\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '437,060', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

They are a heterogeneous group of tumors that display histologic similarities to glia, which include astrocytes and oligodendrocytes; astrocytomas account for the majority of these tumors [1, 2]. The most malignant form, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of cancer, with a median survival of about one year [3]. GBMs can present as one of two distinct subtypes. Primary or “de novo” GBMs arise without any prior clinical or histological evidence of a lower grade precursor lesion and more commonly affect older patients (mean age of 62 years). Secondary or “progressive” GBMs progress from a lower grade glioma and typically develop in younger patients (median age of 45 years) [4]. In general, GBMs exhibit unique properties compared to most other solid tumors. For example, gliomas are highly infiltrative from the outset, thus low-grade (secondary) gliomas disperse throughout the brain. In addition, mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene are frequent in low-grade tumors. This feature departs from many other cancers where TP53 mutations tend to appear later in tumor development during the progression phase [5, 6]. Most significantly, gliomas are resistant to conventional anticancer therapies including radiation and chemotherapy. The consequence is that there has been a stark absence of improvement in prognosis over the last thirty years [7]. Over the last two decades, advances in cancer-related molecular analyses has allowed probing of human brain tumor DNA for presence of mutations in genes known to contribute to many types of cancers. Not surprisingly, mutations have been identified in genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation (INK4A, CDK4, RB, TP53), and growth factor receptor signaling (EGF, PDGF, PTEN) [8, 9]. More advanced analysis through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, which undertook a comprehensive genetic analysis of human GBM, has provided confirmatory evidence of such mutations and revealed a hierarchy of mutations in terms of frequency [10]. Five cancer-related genes were reported to be most frequently mutated in GBM: p53; Pten; EGFR; Rb; and NF1. These results strongly implicate but do not prove that these genes are causal in brain tumor development. Among the failed efforts to develop anti-glioma therapies are cell lines established from human tumors. Although a partial advance, these cell lines suffer from many drawbacks. First and foremost, the actual establishment in culture is a selective and inefficient process in which only a few tumor cells survive that then give rise to the cell line. It is now apparent that this process imposes dramatic alterations in the established cells that make them poor representatives of the original tumor from which they were derived. Indeed when reintroduced into the brains of mice (xenografts), these cells form tumors that do not resemble the original tumors and furthermore, these transplanted tumors often respond to therapies that have no effect on patients. In summary, conventional approaches toward deriving therapies including the use of established glioma cell lines and transplantation of xenografts (human glioma cells transplanted into mice) appear to be of limited value. An alternative approach that has gained increasing attention is the development of genetic mouse models that develop glioma. Physiologically relevant genetic mouse models of high-grade astrocytomas provide one approach to study crucial questions in tumor biology; the rationale for using mouse models is that they allow us to probe and investigate the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression in ways that cannot be done in humans. In the clinic, doctors typically only see the patient once a tumor is significantly advanced. The mechanism by which the tumor initiates and progresses, and in which cell type this occurs has been, for the most part, a black hole. Understanding the natural history of tumor formation could lead to important insights that will have certain impact on prevention and cure. To this end, genetic lesions are engineered in the mouse to generate animal models that in one fashion or another replicate the human malignancy and, thus, allow for in vivo investigation of tumor initiation and development. Many of these mouse models involve introduction of oncogenic mutations in the germline or specific cell subpopulations in the brain [8, 11]. Unfortunately, most of these animal models of glioma suffer from two limitations. First, they often rely on oncogenic activation of genes that are either not clinical features of human glioma, or which target multiple cellular signaling pathways thus complicating analysis. Second, the strategies employed in generating these tumors do not permit identification of the target cells that give rise to the tumors. This latter aspect therefore impedes rigorous determination of precursor/product relationships in cancer formation and thus clinical validation. That is: are the cells giving rise to the tumor in the mouse model the same ones that do so in human glioma? To overcome these issues, our laboratory has focused on generating genetic mouse models of glioma that resemble the human condition. To do so, we genetically engineered mice to lose one of two brain copies of either two or three of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in glioma: NF1, p53 and Pten [10] (TCGA GBM Disease Working Group; ). These mouse models developed glioma in all cases and that by all criteria currently used by neuropathologists who routinely diagnose brain tumors, the mouse tumors were essentially indistinguishable from the human tumors [12]. In one mouse model (Mut3) where Nf1 and p53 were mutated, tumors initiated as low-grade tumors and progressed through the WHO-defined criteria of Grades II, III, and IV (GBM); thus these mice represent a progressive model of secondary glioma. A second mouse model that included mutation of the Pten gene along with Nf1 and p53, also developed astrocytomas with 100% penetrance [13] however the tumors that developed were de novo, high-grade tumors. These data provided experimental evidence that Pten tumor suppressor loss is not contributing to tumor initiation but instead is critical for tumor progression to high grade GBM. Another critical question regarding gliomas is how they originate. Patients present with glioma essentially throughout the brain but where the tumors arose is not known. Our mouse models provide a unique opportunity to study the natural history of tumor development. We can sacrifice mice well before they show illness and ask where we first find evidence of abnormality. Such studies led us to observe that in most cases the first evidence of deregulated cell division occurred in the subventricular zone (SVZ) region of the brain where adult stem cells reside. We therefore proposed that glioma might be a stem/progenitor cell disease and in a recently published study [14] we provide the first conclusive evidence that in mouse models, only SVZ derived stem/progenitor cells can give rise to glioma. Mutation of these genes outside this region failed to yield tumors [14]. We have further shown that we can culture the tumor cells in a very efficient process and these cultured cells, when reimplanted into mouse brains, give rise to tumors that are indistinguishable from the original tumors. These tumor-derived neurospheres (TD-NFCs) therefore mimic the original tumors and hold the promise of retaining tumor properties that will hopefully make them valuable substrates for discovering tumor killing agents [13, 14]. We can show that TD-NFCs exhibit abnormal growth and differentiation properties and we plan to harness these differences to seek out compounds or gene pathways that force the TD-NFCs to either cease dividing or undergo cell death. We have also discovered tumor precursor cells that do not yet have the full complement of tumor-causing mutations. This is an important finding because it uncovers an intermediate step toward tumor development and therefore a potential means to uncover processes that serve as a prelude to tumor formation. We believe that these pretumorigenic cells may be extremely important to study as an intermediate step toward the full-blown tumor phenotype. In summary, we have generated uniquely powerful mouse models of human glioma that develop tumors with 100% penetrance. In addition to the remarkable pathological and molecular similarities of these mouse tumors to human glioma, we have identified the neural stem/progenitor cells as the requisite source of these tumors and moreover have demonstrated our capacity to both culture and transplant primary cells from the tumors [14]. Further, our discovery that the source of these tumors is the stem/progenitor lineage provides us with precise precursor/intermediate/product sources of cells for molecular comparisons, cell-based screens, and cellular validation. This strikingly physiologically relevant mouse model of idiopathic glioma puts us in a unique position to uncover important features that may lead to new therapies, in addition to providing us with a genetic system to both screen and preclinically validate any novel opportunities for therapy. This grant application describes our experimental plans towards this end; we will exploit the TD-NFCs from our mouse glioma models for high throughput screens to identify pathways and molecules that are fundamental for tumor initiation and progression and to seek strategies to impede this process in mice with a view toward clinical applications.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020206\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '90,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The nature and origin of spatial experience was a central question in epistemology and metaphysics for Newton, Leibniz, Berkeley and Kant. Our current model of the physics of the universe, in which space and time are interdependent and curved by matter, is strikingly different from our psychological concepts. Why do we have the spatial concepts that we do, and how do we acquire them? Cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience provide the tools to study the basis for human spatial cognition and behaviour. Spatial cognition can be modelled as information processing, and can also be linked directly with the functions of neuronal populations encoding spatial properties. To understand how we represent space, and why we represent space as we do, it is essential to study the emergence of spatial cognition and behaviour in infancy and childhood. Spatial cognitive development raises three central questions. First, to what degree are different spatial concepts either innate or dependent on experience? Second, do our representations of space use only the egocentric reference frames dictated by our sensory and motor systems, or do we also possess more abstract, viewpoint-independent representations? Third, given that the human brain seems to encode spatial information in several parallel systems that may develop at different rates, how do these representations interact, and how are they selected or integrated to guide behaviour? Major new insights into these problems come from recent work characterising the neuronal basis for spatial representation and behaviour in model organisms and humans. Spatial tasks are closely comparable between species, and direct comparisons increasingly show close correspondence in their neural bases. For example, the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and navigation has been characterised in rodents, in human patients, and in healthy humans imaged via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while navigating in virtual reality. It has also very recently become possible to study the functional development of neuronal populations encoding spatial information in very young rats. Studies of development of human spatial cognition have found striking dissociations in the maturation rates of different representational systems. Those enabling simple bodyreferenced and view-based recall emerge early; those enabling flexible landmark use and integration of multiple spatial information sources appear much later in childhood. Developmental research is increasingly using cue controlled environments enabling isolation of spatial representational systems identifiable with distinct neural substrates in animal models and human patients. The major challenge is to bring these approaches close enough to relate human developmental behavioural data directly to neural mechanisms of developmental change. To this end, new tasks enabling detailed separation of spatial sensory information sources will be devised, new computational models of development will be formulated, and spatial cognitive development will be studied in the wider contexts of reward-mediated behaviour and episodic memory. These new approaches will examine the elementary building blocks of human spatial cognition, how these depend on experience, and how they interact with other cognitive systems to enable adaptive behaviour.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University College London', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020240\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Today they rely on evidence.\r\nAthletes get faster, stronger, and more skilled, decade after decade, in virtually all sports that allow objective measurement. Studying, which is the academic equivalent of training, has not changed significantly in the last century. Students (and learners of all ages) still make decisions based on intuition, not evidence. Only a fraction of students decide how to study based on advice they have received, and only a fraction of that advice is probably based on evidence [1], [2]. It is time for students to study more effectively. My research is dedicated to two goals: understanding the basic principles of learning, and understanding the judgments and decisions people make when they study. I pursue these goals by doing research that applies to everyday studying, but my main focus is basic research on principles of learning and self-regulated study. My research has focused on two principles of learning: retrieval and spacing. Teachers and students do not realize that retrieving a memory is a powerful way to learn [3], [4]. Our research aims to discover why retrieval enhances learning. We have shown, for example, that even retrieval failures enhance subsequent learning. This finding has practical implications but it also constrains theories of retrieval [5], [6]. Distributing study events across time (e.g., studying biology daily instead of once a week) is another counterintuitive, but effective, technique [7–9]. Even when people learn complex concepts (such as finch or sparrow), we found that interleaving concepts was more effective than studying one concept at a time [8], [10]. In addition its practical implications, understanding how interleaving affects concept learning has consequences for theories of concept learning and spacing [11], [12]. How, when, and how much a student decides to study is ultimately up to him or her. People make study decisions based on judgments of learning (JOLs)—predictions  of their ability to remember in the future. Understanding the heuristics and biases that control JOLs is an important theoretical goal [13]. It is also central to helping students study more effectively [14–16], especially because people generally prefer study strategies that maximize immediate performance, rather than more challenging, and effective, strategies like testing and spacing [17]. It was once assumed that memory strength is the cue underlying JOLs [18]. Our research revealed a double dissociation between JOLs and memory strength [19]. JOLs are sensitive to observable cues, but unobservable processes, such as future studying and forgetting, tend to be ignored,\r\nwhich makes JOLs inaccurate [20–22]. Many theoretical puzzles remain. One way of understanding metacognitive processes is to examine their roots in non-human animals [23–25]. We found that animals can make domain-general confidence judgments that transfer across tasks [26], [27]. Progress in research on metacognition in animals—and young children—stands to benefit from investigating the cues, heuristics, and possibly beliefs that guide\r\njudgments.

When the ability to form new memories is lost, as occurs in Alzheimer’s disease or following brain damage, the consequences are devastating. For more than fifty years, scientists have known that damage to the medial temporal lobes (MTL) – a set of heavily interconnected structures deep inside the brain – causes amnesia. However, despite decades of intense research, the means by which different structures in the MTL contribute to memory acquisition and loss remain the subject of intense debate. The most influential view of memory organization holds that structures in the MTL form a dedicated long-term memory system, with no role in other cognitive processes such as perception, attention, or working memory. This view is consistent with a popular paradigm in cognitive neuroscience, in which the brain is understood in terms of neatly segregated modules that map onto broad psychological constructs. Within this framework, it is argued that separate brain systems account for distinct cognitive processes, like “declarative memory,” “priming,” or “recollection.” Here, I suggest that this view is neither the most parsimonious nor the most compelling account of the data. Though MTL structures are essential for memory, findings from my laboratory indicate that these MTL structures do, in addition, play a critical role in perception\r\n– a finding that is fundamentally incompatible with the notion of a dedicated MTL memory system specifically, or cognitive modules more generally. In contrast to a modular view of memory, I argue that the functions of brain regions can be better understood in terms of the representations they contain and the computations they perform. I suggest that the MTL should be considered in terms of a continuous, hierarchical account of cognitive processing that begins in the ventral visual stream, a processing pathway known to be critical for the perception of objects. I propose that the perirhinal cortex (PRC) – a key structure of the putative MTL system – sits at the apex of this ventral visual stream, representing the complex conjunctions of features that comprise objects. These complex “object-level” PRC representations allow for fine-grained distinctions across objects, which becomes especially critical under conditions of high visual interference when differentiation of similar items among competing alternatives is required. Guided by computational modelling complemented with neuropsychology and neuroimaging, we will provide a unified and mechanistic account of why MTL damage affects both mnemonic and perceptual processes in humans. This project stands to redefine current conceptions of memory disorders by shifting the focus from explaining deficits in terms of impaired cognitive modules (e.g., for long-term memory or perception) to explaining deficits in terms of impoverished neural representations. This idea has profound implications for cognitive rehabilitation and lays the foundation for new therapeutic\r\ntechniques in memory disorders.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Toronto', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020376\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Take the simplest possible example - the\r\nchoice to do anything at all, rather than the alternative of doing nothing. This simple\r\nconsideration leads us to a central theme in all decision sciences. We act because there is in acting. It prevents starvation, thirst, and predation, and promotes procreation.\r\nBecause different courses of action will lead to outcomes of different , the decisionmaking\r\nproblem, at its simplest, is to “often select courses of action with high value, and\r\nseldom those with low value”. Solving this problem is central to the survival of all animals, but it is far from trivial. It\r\nis perhaps not surprising, therefore, that our brains devote substantial resources towards\r\nplanning and selecting profitable choices - neural responses that reflect the value of\r\ndifferent actions can be found across much of the brain. Indeed, often multiple cognitive\r\nmechanisms, supported by separable neural circuits, have evolved to solve the same realworld\r\nproblems. Hence, if we wish to understand how humans control their behaviour, a\r\nmajor challenge is to understand the different computations performed in these different\r\nneural circuits, and how and when they might each contribute to valuation, choice and\r\nbehavioural control. In order to address this challenge, I believe it is critical to consider two separate but\r\nrelated problems. First, what different computations contribute to behaviour that is being\r\nstudied? Second, how might these computations reveal themselves in the neural data that\r\nwe can measure? In my laboratory, we use formal models in conjunction with behavioural\r\nexperiments and several different types of neural recordings to study learning and decisionmaking\r\nin humans. We aim to dissect and understand the computations that control\r\nbehaviour, and the roles of different brain regions in performing them. We focus principally\r\non the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that appears critical for these complex functions;\r\nhowever, because brain regions do not act in isolation, we have also built sophisticated\r\ntools for measuring anatomical connections between remote brain regions, and their impact\r\non regional brain function. In all of our work, through close collaboration with researchers\r\nwho work with animal models, we relate the large-scale measurements that can be made in\r\nhumans to cellular measurements and direct interventions that can be made in nonhuman\r\nspecies. By combining these computational and experimental strategies, we try to provide\r\nessential links between different levels of neural understanding: From neurochemistry\r\nthrough network architecture and computation to behaviour. For example, in our most\r\nrecent series of studies focusing on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, we have not only\r\nshown the effect that regional neurotransmitter density has on a complex behaviour such as\r\nfree choice, but we can also explain why, at the level of cellular responses.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Oxford', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020372\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Yet many fundamental gaps remain in our knowledge of human brain evolution, development and organization. How is it that our closest evolutionary relatives, chimpanzees, share 98.7% of our DNA and yet lack the higher order cognition and spoken language that make us human? At least in part, the answer is likely to lie in the frontal cortex, which, more than any other region of the human brain, defines us as a species (Kostovic, 1990; Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Fuster, 1997). Our recent analysis has uncovered that distinct areas of the developing human frontal cortex can be distinguished from other cortical regions by transient, lasting, and combinatorial expression of genes. In addition, this initial study also revealed that the complexity of gene expression within different areas of the frontal cortex is more complex that previously thought. The majority of these human genes has not been previously characterized and encode a variety of proteins ranging from transcription factors, axon guidance molecules, ion channels, synaptic transmission proteins, and metabolic proteins. Furthermore, preliminary analysis revealed that majority of the genes are not expressed at detectable levels in the frontal cortex of the developing and adult mouse, suggesting that the higher frontal expression of these genes may be unique to humans and other mammals with highly developed and complex frontal/prefrontal cortex. The proposed study aims to examine how our frontal cortex differs from other closely related species at the molecular and structural level during critical phases of cellular and cognitive development. We hypothesize that some of these genes will also be candidate genes that underlie the functional specialization of the human frontal cortex. Our approach is unique in the sense that we propose to analyze differences in gene expression in the developing frontal cortex of human, non-human primates, and mouse. We have chosen to specifically address developmental changes because major structural and connectivity differences between human and non-human primate brains likely arose as a result of differences during development. Thus, comparative functional genomics studies that examine developmental stages are much more likely to yield results of evolutionary significance than studies of adult brains. Once the candidate genes are identified, their expression and function in neurons of the developing frontal cortex will also be examined. We will selectively target those candidate genes that are expressed by the projection or pyramidal neurons, which occupy a central position in all cortical circuits. They constitute the sole output and the largest input system of the cortex, as well as represent the major target of projections from other brain regions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Yale University School of Medicine', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020165\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Still others who exhibit normal cognitive functioning might be dissatisfied with their achievements, and wish to seek out means to improve their cognitive skills. Two contemporary ways to improve cognitive abilities in healthy and atypical participants are: 1) cognitive training to affect the brain and impact behaviour; 2) brain stimulation to directly affect areas that might not function at an optimal (atypical populations) or the most optimal (typical populations) level. Recent research in my lab has successfully combined these methods to further improve skill acquisition and cognitive outcomes. Notably, our research to date has primarily focused on healthy adults, mostly with high-level cognitive abilities (university students). I aim to extend my research in several directions by: 1) optimising cognitive training and brain stimulation by combining individualised training and brain stimulation in an intervention that is inspired by the 'personalised medicine'\r\napproach; 2) uncovering the potential neurocognitive cost(s) that might be associated with neurocognitive enhancement, a point that has been almost completely neglected in the fields of brain stimulation and cognitive training; and 3) utilising neuroimaging methods to shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the performance enhancement (and, possibly, cost) produced by cognitive training and brain stimulation. This integrative approach will allow me to take this young field a leap forward. In this programme of research, I will adopt numerical cognition as a working model. This is motivated by theoretical reasons, because compared to more artificial training paradigms, numerical cognition is an excellent and highly realistic model for cognitive skill acquisition and complex cognitive skills, which can be easily translated to other domains (e.g., reading, attention, executive functions). Moreover, by applying cognitive training to numerical abilities this work will have high ecological validity and an increased likelihood to be translated beyond laboratory research to the public good. For practical reasons, numerical abilities represent an important cognitive asset, which affect one's level of education, career opportunities, salary, and socioeconomic status, as well as physical and mental health. Moreover, the financial and societal burden of low numeracy levels on our modern, technology-driven society further highlight the urgent need for basic and applied research on numerical cognition. This ambitious, multidisciplinary programme will provide basic and potentially translational research implications in multiple fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and education.

No scientist nor perfumer can predict an odor based on its molecular structure, or decipher a molecular structure based on its smell. It is this puzzle we aim to solve. In vision and audition coding was probed by linking critical physical stimulus dimensions (wavelength/frequency) to patterns of neural activity. But what are the critical physical dimensions in olfaction? Scientists have probed this problem by linking restricted physico-chemical aspects of the stimulus, such as carbon chain-length, to neural activity. However, the olfactory system did not evolve to decode carbon chain-length, but rather to encode the world around us as revealed in olfactory perception. In other words, rather than following the beaten path of probing the system \"from molecule to percept\" (a phrase used by us and others in countless reviews on olfaction), a more fruitful path may lie in reversing the common approach, and probing the system \"from percept to molecule\". With this in mind we developed a novel perception-based olfactory space with tangible olfactory axes, based on statistical dimension-reduction of perceptual estimates obtained from human subjects. If the proposed space is valid, it should serve to predict neural activity in the olfactory system. Here we will test the hypothesis that our generated space predicts odorant-induced neural activity in human olfactory epithelium and cortex. Whereas cortical processing will be probed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and implanted electrodes, epithelial processing will be probed with novel methods for measurement from human neurons in vivo. This will include the ground-up effort to develop fibre-optic optical imaging of intrinsic signals from neurons in the human nose. In vision and audition scientists can probe the system within agreed dimensions (color/wavelength; pitch/frequency). Similarly, our proposal generates an olfactory space where one can systematically probe molecular receptor tuning-curves, cellular spatial and temporal coding schemes, as well as higher-order perception.

The standard account assumes that working memory is maintained by static\r\npatterns of neural activity, as if frozen in time to preserve a still-frame representation of the past.\r\nBut new methods for measuring and analysing brain activity reveal a much more dynamic portrait:\r\nneural activity patterns are constantly changing, even when the cognitive state remains stable. I am exploring a new theoretical framework to understand how working memory is implemented in\r\na dynamic brain. According to a model, working memory is best understood as a\r\ntemporary shift in how we process new information, rather than a representation of the past\r\npreserved in persistent activity. Based on insights from systems neuroscience, I propose that this\r\ntemporary shift in coding properties is achieved by constructing new temporary pathways within\r\nthe prefrontal cortex. It is well-established that the brain’s wiring diagram adapts slowly over time. However connectivity\r\nis also modulated by short-lived neurophysiological changes. Transient patterns of are sometimes referred to as a ‘hidden’ state, because they are not directly observable\r\nusing standard recording measures. For the same reason, neuroscience has been dominated by\r\nimages of brain activity, even though we know from first principles that processing in the brain is\r\ndefined by connectivity. Activity is simply easier to measure than connectivity, especially when\r\nmeasurement tools are limited by poor temporal resolution (e.g., fMRI). Therefore, to test the role of dynamic coding in working memory, we have been developing new\r\nmethods to infer the underlying connectivity states. Our research employs computational\r\napproaches to infer temporary patterns of connectivity during working memory using non-invasive\r\nwhole-brain methods with real-time resolution (e.g., MEG). Zooming in to a more detailed level of\r\nanalysis, we are also tracking memory-dependent changes in connectivity between individual\r\nneurons and local neural populations by teaming up with neurophysiologists and clinical\r\nneurosurgeons. This integrative approach is essential if we are to uncover fundamental neural\r\nprinciples of high-level human cognition. Finally, a dynamic coding framework could also shed new light on individual differences in working\r\nmemory. In particular, we hypothesise that working memory capacity is limited by\r\nencoding/retrieval rather than maintaining a stable activity state. This is important, because\r\nindividual differences in working memory ability predict performance on laboratory tests of\r\nintelligence as well as real-world measures of academic progress. A better understanding of working\r\nmemory will have broad implications for improving cognitive capacity in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Oxford', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020405\\n', 'year': '2014', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

When this ability is lost, as occurs in the early stages of Alzheimer’s dementia, the result is devastating. While over half a century of research has provided us with a detailed understanding of how the brain determines current location and orientation, we know surprisingly little about how the brain represents our spatial relationship to distant goals or guides navigation to them. A recent neuroimaging study of London taxi drivers suggests a network of brain regions may act as a navigational guidance system. These regions include the medial temporal lobe, posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex. However, the precise role played by each brain region and how they interact during navigation remains unclear. Our hypothesis, based on computational models, is that during navigation the medial temporal lobe computes a vector to the goal and estimates future paths at decision points. The posterior parietal cortex computes the direction to the goal relative to the body’s axis and the environment. While these brain regions help select efficient routes and find shortcuts, another system in the striatum is thought to guide navigation through learned associations (e.g. the habit of turning left at the pub). The prefrontal cortex may help switch between these systems, and cooperate with them to learn goal locations. Emerging evidence highlights the importance of theta band oscillations (4-12Hz), which may allow neural activity to be synchronized between different brain areas, creating time-windows for information transfer or modulation of processing. To test this model, we have developed a new approach to studying navigation in the real world. Volunteers initially learn an environment using the method London taxi drivers use to learn ‘The Knowledge’ of London. Subsequently, volunteers undergo neuroimaging while watching first-person-view movies and choosing their direction to the goal at each street junction. By conducting this research in parallel with experiments recording neuronal ensembles in rodents, we aim to understand how brain networks support navigation at different levels of anatomical specificity and cross-fertilize analytical approaches to neural and behavioural data. We expect this research to lead to major advances in our understanding of the neural bases of navigation and goal-directed behavior. The research is important because we know little about how our brain updates and tracks dynamic information in real-world environments. Characterising the interactions between regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex is highly relevant to memory in general as well as to diseases such as schizophrenia where disrupted connectivity may be critical.

Motor control, however, is a hard problem -- complex computations are necessary to control even the most mundane of movements. One can appreciate this fact when noting that even advanced robotic devices only poorly approximate human performance, or when watching a stroke victim try to relearn motor skills once taken for granted. What happens in the human brain when we learn new motor skills? Because recovery from stroke and healthy motor learning are likely driven by overlapping mechanisms, this question is not only important to basic neuroscience, but also has profound clinical implications. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most powerful techniques for studying activity in the human brain and ought to play a key role in answering this question. However, despite many efforts over the past two decades fMRI studies have contributed disappointingly little to our understanding of motor learning. Hundreds of published studies have resulted in a bewildering and often inconsistent picture of activation changes, without providing a satisfying answer to what \"more\" or \"less\" activity means. I believe that the main impediment in the field is that we lack explicit theories that that tell us what fMRI signal we should observe when a region undergoes learning. The focus of my research program is therefore to develop this missing link between motor learning and signals observable in fMRI. Such a theory has two requirements: First, we need a computational description of the neural learning processes. It has become clear that motor learning is not monolithic, but consists of a number of interacting mechanisms. For example, the motor system learns from various forms of reinforcement, from the small errors that occur during motor execution, and from simply performing the same movement repeatedly. These mechanisms likely rely on different plasticity processes and therefore have their own neural signatures. Second, we need a theoretical framework that predicts the form of the neural that result from learning processes. What distinguishes trained movements from untrained movements? Should we expect more activation? A larger area of activation? I have developed a modeling approach that suggests a novel way of detecting motor skill representations in distributed patterns of activity. My research program aims to develop a quantitative theory that bridges the gap between task-level descriptions and observable fMRI signals. I will test these ideas in healthy human brain using stimulation techniques to influence learning processes, and in stroke recovery. By using fMRI to observe in vivo changes in the human brain, these developments will accelerate the development of new diagnostic techniques, and ultimately, guide our search for more effective rehabilitation techniques.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University College London', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020283\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Patients diagnosed with the highest grade MG, grade IV glioblastoma (GBM), survive for a mere 12-14 months after diagnosis despite aggressive surgical resection and treatment regimens. Multimodal approaches using radiation with concurrent chemotherapy (temozolomide) resulted in only a marginal increase in patients’ median survival. An incomplete understanding of how catalogued genetic aberrations dictate phenotypic hallmarks of the disease, particularly intense therapy (apoptosis) resistance, combined with a highly therapy-resistant cancer stem cell population (glioma stem cells, GSCs) have conspired to make GBM an enigmatic and incurable disease. The continued lack of success in treating high-grade gliomas with targeted (receptor) tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which have proven to be effective in other malignancies, has further underlined the overarching need to identify and dissect genetic aberrations in cell death pathways that play pivotal roles in the profound resistance to therapy exhibited by GBM. Consequently, three of the most fundamental questions in glioma research and drug development are: Can we identify anti-apoptotic mechanisms in GBM tumors that act as roadblocks for conventional and target therapies to induce tumor cell-specific apoptosis? How are these anti-apoptotic proteins regulated? And can we harness such information to neutralize their expression and function? My laboratory has begun to address these questions on multiple levels. Recently, we discovered the unique Bcl-2 family protein Bcl2-Like 12 (Bcl2L12) as a novel anti-apoptotic glioma oncoprotein that targets key pathways important for gliomagenesis. Bcl2L12 exhibits robust overexpression in more than 90% of primary GBM tumors with low or undetectable levels in cells of glial origin in normal brain surrounding tumor tissue or in low-grade astrocytoma (1). Enforced expression of Bcl2L12 in primary cortical astrocytes enhanced cellular growth, conferred marked apoptosis resistance, yet engendered cellular necrosis and affected malignant transformation (1). RNAi-loss-of-function studies demonstrated that Bcl2L12 neutralization sensitizes glioma cells toward apoptosis, and most importantly, reduces intracranial tumor formation with increased (decreased) apoptotic (proliferative) indices and enhanced tumor-free survival (1). On the biochemical level, these oncogenic actions related significantly to the capacity of Bcl2L12 to inhibit apoptosis by neutralizing effector caspase-3 and -7 activity downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosome activity (1, 2). Intriguingly, post-mitochondrial caspase activation acts as a molecular switch between apoptotic and necrotic cell death (3, 4): Due to mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release in the context of concomitantly neutralized effector caspase activation, oxidative phosphorylation and intracellular ATP levels decrease rendering cells unable to maintain ion homeostasis and provoking cellular edema, dissolution of organelles and plasma membranes. Indeed, Bcl2L12 expression promoted necrosis in response to apoptotic stimulation. In addition, Bcl2L12 physically interacts with and neutralizes the transactivational activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein by abrogating p53 binding to its target gene promoters (5, 6). By blocking apoptosis and p53 signaling, and redirecting the death program to necrosis, the molecular profile of Bcl2L12 provides a rational molecular explanation for hallmark features of GBM           ", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Northwestern University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020295\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Despite this fine-scale complexity, coarse-scale ecological patterns can be highly regular. For example, the relationship between area and species diversity exhibits consistent shapes across different ecosystems. How does this order arise and what processes drive it? Which ecological processes should we manage to conserve biological diversity effectively? My research applies modeling techniques from mathematics and physics to large-scale ecological datasets to answer such questions. I focus on tropical forests, whose hyperdiverse tree communities have long been a source of biological fascination. I also study island systems, because islands act as microcosms whose relatively simple structure can reveal glimpses of fundamental ecological principles. In recent years, my lab has focused on a key emergent property of ecosystems: species diversity. We have developed theoretical models of species diversity that predict phase transitions as an exogenous variable changes continuously. We recently confirmed the existence of such a transition in a dataset of islands from 100 archipelagos around the world, thereby resolving a classic ecological conundrum known as the  “small;island effect”. Specifically, we showed that on small islands, species diversity is at a dynamic equilibrium determined by environmental constraints (niches), but that as island area increases past a threshold size, equilibrium diversity arises instead from a balance between immigration and stochastic extinction. This is satisfying not only because it shows how the dominant processes determining emergent ecosystem properties can change across scales, but because it unifies hitherto disparate bodies of ecological theory that, as we now see, describe phases on different sides of the transition. In the coming years, I propose to develop my theory further by 1. Building mathematical models that unify my current island and mainland models. 2. Using larger archipelago datasets to test the theory’s island predictions further, including a prediction that there are in fact three possible phases mediated by two transitions. 3. Exploring the robustness of the theory’s predictions to the addition of strong environmental forcing terms, such as those arising from climate fluctuations. 4. Applying the insights gained from islands to understand the processes structuring mainland tropical forest diversity. By understanding which factors are the dominant influences on biodiversity in different contexts, we will gain a better understanding not only of how our planet became home to such myriad life forms, but also of what processes must be managed in order to conserve this diversity.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'National University of Singapore', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020470\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Even with these impressive advances in the fields of experimental neuroscience and machine learning, neither approach in isolation can explain how important acts of cognition, such as perception, learning and memory work. My approach is to develop to describe how cognitive behaviors emerge from the cooperative activity of multi-scale neural processes. These theories are based, as building blocks, on neural network models flexible enough to accommodate sufficient levels of biological detail at the neuronal, synaptic and circuit levels. They are based on high quality data from well-designed imaging, electrophysiology and behavior experiments, and on new and existing mathematical and computational frameworks, derived from machine learning and statistical physics, adapted for biological fidelity. This cross-disciplinary approach can provide important insights about how neural circuits in the brain learn and execute cognitive functions ranging from working memory to reasoning and intuition. My current and future work is based on a general framework that I developed over the past several years. For example, during my PhD thesis, which focused on the mathematical analysis of neural networks, I discovered and characterized a phase transition between internally generated and sensory dominated dynamics. I suggested that this phase transition, in which sensory stimuli actively suppress ongoing activity might be relevant to how the brain interprets subtle cues within the context of its internal experiential and motivational  state to extract unambiguous representations of the external world. Electrophysiology and imaging studies in a number of brain regions have since validated the predictions of this work, including details of its frequency dependence and the time course for switching neural activity. This phase transition is also crucial to subsequently developed methods used to construct networks that perform interesting functions. My network studies employed methods borrowed from random matrix theory and statistical mechanics. These tools have now become an essential part of the data analysis and modeling arsenal. My Princeton colleagues and I currently develop and employ a broad set of methods from physics, engineering and computer science to construct new conceptual frameworks to describe the relationship between cognitive processes and biophysics across many scales of biological organization. Work along these lines has uncovered how sensitivity to natural stimuli arises in neurons, how this selectivity influences sensorimotor learning, and how the neural sequences observed in different brain regions arise from plastic yet largely disordered circuits. In the future, I will pursue several interrelated research directions, including (1) exploring whether neural sequences provide a substrate for working memory, specifically during accumulation of evidence in favor of a decision and during imitation learning of repetitive behaviors, (2) uncovering how general cognitive maps for representing behaviorally relevant contextual variables are implemented through network population dynamics, and (3) developing an unsupervised learning procedure for training recurrently connected networks to execute complex cognitive actions, and relating this to how animals and humans learn.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Princeton University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020466\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Nonetheless, a significant plurality of  complex systems satisfy the following conditions: they are made of many interacting particles that  can be assumed to obey Newton‘s Laws, and they are driven by external forces while surrounded by a thermal  bath with a well-defined temperature.  Within this “big tent” of nonequilibrium many-body assemblies we can fit subjects as diverse as turbulent fluids,  active gels, classical  computers,  and even living organisms.  And, despite their great disparity, we expect that all of these phenomena will be constrained in what physical properties they exhibit by  the dictates of  general  theoretical  results that have been proven for the far-from-equilibrium regime in the last two decades. In particular, it has been established that the probability distributions for  dynamics of systems thus described obey a general thermodynamic constraint: the  probability of seeing the system execute a particular trajectory is exponentially greater than that of the trajectory’s time-reversed movie in proportion to the amount of heat  dissipated during the forward movie.  Put another way, as a result of the underlying  time-reversibility of Newtonian mechanics, any apparent statistical irreversibility in the  dynamical direction of a driven system’s stochastic evolution has to be ‘paid for’ with the  transfer of energy to the surrounding thermal bath.   This heat can either be supplied  by going downhill in internal energy, or, more intriguingly, through the absorption of work  from surrounding drives.

Our work is guided by three fundamental interconnected biological questions: Can we identify generic rules that allow us to predict the gene-expression patterns in developing organisms? How do intra- and inter-cellular force networks coordinate their actions to realize highly reproducible tissue-folding processes during embryonic development? Can we develop robust algorithms to reconstruct from single-cell sequencing data the spatial position of individual cells, their temporal position in the differentiation cycle, and ultimately their biological function in multicellular organisms? To tackle these problems quantitatively, we are investigating new mathematical and computational approaches that combine traditional modeling techniques based on deterministic and stochastic differential equations with modern statistical, graph-theoretic and topological concepts. Our efforts are aided by the close collaboration with experimentalists in the fields of biology and biophysics. We are specifically interested in integrating advanced image and data analysis methods with predictive modeling techniques that are applicable to broad classes of complex biological systems and can be rigorously tested in experiments. Development of innovative mathematical approaches is necessitated by the current revolution in single-cell microfluidics and optimal imaging techniques, which will offer access to unprecedented high-resolution data over the next decade. Detailed simultaneous measurements of the individual states of thousands of cells will produce high-dimensional data matrices and tensors that need to be compressed and analyzed efficiently with minimal loss of biologically relevant information. The size and complexity of these data pose severe conceptual and practical challenges to traditional bio-physical and bio-mathematical theory: The relevant macro-state variables of cells are a priori unknown, the data may be noisy and incomplete, and the dimensionality may be so large that conventional models require a prohibitively large number of parameters and, hence, cannot be tested conclusively and become difficult to interpret. To help overcome these limitations, our research program integrates elements from applied mathematics, biophysics and quantitative biology to realize four main goals: (1) Design and implementation of efficient data-completion and dimensionality-reduction algorithms to reconstruct gene expression profiles with high accuracy and to identify relevant macroscopic state-variables from large-scale RNA sequencing data. (2) Robust identification of persistent topological features in optical imaging and sequencing data by combining information-theoretic concepts with Morse-Smale complex analysis to reconstruct intercellular force networks during morphogenesis and detect pathological tissue deformations. (3) Design and implementation of network-based and continuum-based field theories that focus on predicting the spatio-temporal dynamics of experimentally observed topological features. (4) Systematic verification of model predictions against data provided by our collaborators from sequencing experiments in single cells as well as gene expression and force measurements in multicellular systems.

Nearly a century of research has demonstrated that speech production and perception can be influenced by the physical context in which they take place (e.g., noisy environments differ from quiet environments). However, much less is known about how specific physical and linguistic contexts interact during speech perception and how the challenges induced by some contexts may be modulated by factors such as listener age. Investigating the impact of context-specific factors on communication is critical to fully understanding human cognition or to design solutions for everyday communication challenges. We aim to identify the impacts of a set of physical and linguistic contexts, specifically healthcare. We have developed a corpus of medically-related sentences which contain words that have been normed for frequency and familiarity. We plan to use this corpus to develop experiments that will allow us to examine how laboratory-based behavior translates to ecologically valid scenarios across a range of populations. Our aims are to: (1) measure “baseline” perceptual performance for younger and older adults on sentences with medical terminology presented in quiet, in speech-shaped noise, and in hospital noise, (2) compare these baseline measures to more ecologically-valid scenarios using simulated healthcare provider - patient communication and simulated telehealth situations with both younger and older adults, and (3) compare these baseline measures to perception of medically-related speech from an unfamiliar accent (i.e., non-native speakers) for both younger and older adults. In addition to collecting measures of speech perception, we will collect measures of hearing status and of cognitive function. The results of these studies will inform our understanding of how real-world experience may interact with some of the physiological and cognitive consequences of aging when perceiving speech outside of the laboratory. For example, older adults likely have more experience with healthcare situations and typically have larger vocabularies due to increased life experience compared to younger adults. These effects may help them to better understand medical communication, even in noisy environments (e.g., hospitals). On the other hand, older adults are also likely to have reduced access to the acoustic signal due to age-related hearing loss and slower cognitive processing than younger adults. These factors may hinder their ability to understand medical communication, and may be differentially affected by hospital noise, which may be more acoustically distracting to a listener than other types of noise. The team for this project includes two experts in speech and language processing (Drs. Melissa Baese-Berk & Tessa Bent), an expert in acoustics of healthcare settings (Dr. Erica Ryherd), and an expert in geriatric medicine (Dr. Natalie Manley).

For a comatose patient to recover  cognition,  the brainstem must  first  generate  ascending arousal signals to  reactivate the cerebral cortex and  establish conscious awareness.   When  brainstem arousal nuclei or their axonal connections are  disrupted, the cortex is quiescent  and cognition cannot occur,  even if the cortex itself is  uninjured.  Cortical  regions critical to cognition remain dormant until  brainstem  arousal inputs  are restored. Despite the essential role of the brainstem in consciousness and cognition, the neuroanatomic  connections that link the brainstem to the cortex have not been mapped in the human brain.  Current models of human brainstem connectivity are almost entirely based upon extrapolations  from animal studies, which are inherently limited due to evolutionary differences in human  neuroanatomy.  Moreover, the specific brainstem neurons and axonal connections that are  necessary for recovery of  cognitive function  in patients with brainstem  injury are unknown. For over one million civilians worldwide who experience a coma each year due to traumatic  brain injury, and for thousands of military personnel who have experienced a traumatic coma  since 2001, this gap in knowledge significantly impairs clinical care.  Clinicians are unable to  detect preserved brainstem connections capable of supporting  recovery, which leads to  inaccurate prognostication and creates uncertainty for families facing decisions about goals of  care.  Furthermore, with recent studies showing that pharmacologic and electrophysiologic  therapies can reactivate the cortex in selected patients, a brainstem connectivity map is needed  to  identify patients who may benefit from stimulant therapy. My  laboratory is creating personalized connectivity maps of the brainstem arousal network in  civilians and military personnel with traumatic coma to elucidate  the mechanisms by which the  brainstem modulates human consciousness and to test the efficacy of stimulant therapies that  promote recovery of consciousness.  We have developed ultra-high resolution  magnetic  resonance imaging methods to map brainstem connectivity in  ex vivo human brain specimens,  and we have translated these methods to the  intensive care  unit for brainstem connectivity  mapping in patients with acute traumatic coma.  We now aim to develop  a  quantitative, network-based model of brainstem modulation of consciousness that will predict recovery from coma and predict individual patient responses to stimulant therapy.  The  rationale for a network-based  approach is that our preliminary studies indicate that no single brainstem nucleus (i.e. network  node) or axonal pathway (i.e. network connection) is essential for consciousness.  Rather, there  appear to be emergent properties  of  the brainstem arousal network’s entire set of connections that enable recovery  from coma. Over the next six years, I will  build a translational research program  to identify the connectivity  properties of the brainstem arousal network that are essential for human consciousness and  cognition. This research program will use graph theoretical analysis to create a quantitative,  clinically useful network model for how the brainstem reactivates the cortex after traumatic  coma.  The development of this network model will improve acute care for civilians and military  personnel with  traumatic coma and  is a crucial step towards the discovery of novel treatments that promote recovery of consciousness and cognition.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020463\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Children have greater difficulty than adults processing speech in noise. Infants are especially vulnerable to noise, and need higher signal-to-noise ratios to understand speech. Noise exposure affects critical processes in language acquisition (e.g., learning and recognizing words) and cognitive performance (e.g., sustained attention), and is linked to negative health and developmental outcomes. Furthermore, it is significantly harder for bilinguals than monolinguals to process speech in noise; this group difference is present with different noise types and age groups. However, the data available has come primarily from artificial laboratory measures, and from children raised in mid-socioeconomic status (SES) families who have the means to travel to labs. Little is known about the effect of noise pollution on cognitive and linguistic development in children from at-risk communities. The reality is that bilingual homes in America are disproportionally low SES, with Latino dual-language learners making up the largest group. Children in these families are at a higher long-term risk for academic failure. Critically, poverty is also linked to more noise exposure from traffic, airports, and from sources in the home. Thus, it is important to understand (i) how environmental noise affects cognitive and linguistic performance in a wider range of infants (including those raised in bilingual environments and in low-SES communities), and (ii) what mechanisms might help explain the relation between noise exposure and early cognitive and linguistic abilities. There is evidence suggesting that exposure to noise disrupts the emergence of sound representations in the brain, which are needed to process auditory input (especially spoken language). With this in mind, this project combines neural (Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials measured with a portable system), behavioral (portable eye-tracking), and naturalistic measures of the home listening environment (wearable recorders that collect ecologically-valid measures of sound sources). We will document the characteristic of the listening environment in which infants are being raised, and examine how this factor influences auditory cortex development, and the acquisition of early cognitive and linguistic skills. Specifically, our data will allow us to determine whether infants who have greater exposure to noise in their home show poorer auditory cortex function and delayed language and cognitive performance and whether negative effects of noise are different in bilinguals compared to monolinguals. These goals will be achieved employing a longitudinal design in which measures are collected in the home across timepoints when children are between 9 and 18 months. This is a timeframe in which there are significant changes in infants’ cognitive and linguistic skills that are critical for future development. The portability of the experimental setup will enable testing of infants from mixed socioeconomic backgrounds, allowing us to explore this factor as a covariate. The signal-to-noise ratio (e.g., limiting the amount of time that the TV is on in the background, improving classroom building codes) may be malleable.

Infants and parents explore the world together in a coordinated “dance” of attention, movement, and communication. Research that leverages wearable technology to quantify the dynamic, embodied nature of infant experience highlight the importance of this approach in generating new knowledge about infant development. Yet, most studies of neurodevelopmental social-communication disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), have been highly constrained to the artificial laboratory setting. The application of head-mounted eye tracking to the study of parent-infant interactions offers novel insights into how context dynamically shapes infant experience. Disruptions in this coordinated, dynamic system could have a profound impact on the acquisition of communication skills, especially for at-risk infants. Action continuously drives and modifies infant attention, suggesting that atypical sensory-motor behavior in the early months of life may relate to a developmental cascade leading to atypical trajectories of social-communication development and ASD. No studies to date have used head-mounted eye tracking to study the emergence of autism in infancy. The lack of research in this area is surprising in light of significant evidence for motor and attention abnormalities in infants at an elevated likelihood of ASD. Studies of autism in infancy have traditionally neglected a key component of infant cognition: dynamic, embodied experience. At present, there is an inadequate explanation of how infant behavior predicts the emergence of atypical social communication and ASD in at-risk populations. Opportunities exist for uncovering new etiological mechanisms and novel theories of change that can lead to innovative interventions for ASD in at-risk populations. Sensitive, specific measures of the dynamic system in which naturalistic, social interactions occur may reveal very early developmental vulnerabilities in ASD. The overarching aim of this proposal is to use infant embodied experience within real-world interactional contexts to map a developmental pathway for typical and atypical social communication for infants at elevated neurodevelopmental risk. In a prospective, longitudinal design, we propose to examine coordinated attention during parent-infant interactions at 4 and 8 months of age for infants at elevated and low likelihood of ASD. First, we will identify predictive associations between dyadic and triadic coordinated attention at 4 months and triadic coordinated attention at 8 months. We will then determine the influence of motor development on coordinated attention at 4 and 8 months across ASD likelihood groups. Finally, we will examine how infant attention and movement contextualized in social interaction provide a developmental landscape for the emergence of social communication at 18 months, particularly for infants at elevated neurodevelopmental risk. This proposal leverages wearable technology, the principal investigator’s clinical and scientific expertise in autism and longitudinal research, and a key collaboration to explore dynamic attention patterns and movement as critical early indicators of social communication and ASD. Understanding how moment-to-moment attention during naturalistic interactions is influenced by context and genetic vulnerability can delineate the role of embodied social attention in the development of autism and will pave the way for innovative interventions within the first year of life.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of South Carolina', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2021-3177', 'year': '2021', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Previous work in psychology and organizational psychology focused on measuring resilience as a trait and determining factors that affect it. While data-driven longitudinal methods that focus on changes over time at both individual and group levels within a social context are key to determining and understanding resilience and its change over time, previous work is limited methodologically to surveys, which rely on self-report and do not measure such dynamic aspects of resilience. We will address this research gap through two research aims: (1) developing and assessing novel data-driven methods for studying resilience through context-rich, real-world-like environments to explore cognition longitudinally, and (2) using this data-driven methodology to study resilience among college students, specifically how it manifests itself and evolves over time. Moreover, we aim to study how individual resilience impacts college students and how they learn new coping strategies over time through small group interactions as groups face unpredictable events. Our novel approach uses Alternate Reality Games (ARGs), games that embed participants in an alternate narrative but use physical locations and real-world applications such as mobile phone text messages. Although psychologists have noted this promising use, to our knowledge there has not been any study demonstrating the validity of using ARGs for studying human cognition, and, in particular, resilience. ARGs has the potential to transform psychology research, including an environment where researchers can: (1) observe participants in a (semi-)controlled manner through real-world temporal interactions, (2) engage participants over time with real consequences, (3) systematically and automatically collect multidimensional context-rich data about participants’ actions and the settings within which these actions are made as well as deliver surveys over time, (4) scale and replicate studies with hundreds to potentially thousands of participants, and (5) allow precise modeling and measurement of team and individual behaviors. We will develop the ARG using a participatory design method where participants become co-designers in the process of development. This is meant to ensure that participants are motivated by the narrative and the activities designed. We will then use the ARG to conduct several studies with first year college students as our target population. We will use sequential modeling and qualitative analysis to analyze the behavioral and survey data collected to understand resiliency and coping strategies, self-efficacy, affect, and understand how these constructs change over time and are influenced by the tasks, context, and group members. Given that previous work has not explored the dynamics of resilience or understand how it evolves over time, we contribute a new methodological approach to study the dynamics of resilience, which will lead to several broader impacts, including a methodology that others can use to study dynamics of other psychological phenomena. Further, results of our studies on resilience can guide future studies on interventions that can increase resilience.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California-Santa Cruz', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2021-3034', 'year': '2021', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Many of these young people receive a diagnosis, such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. These diagnostic categories have provided the lens through which neurodevelopmental differences are viewed. Our research, theories and interventions are all organised around the assumption that the diagnostic framework reflects underlying reality – that each diagnostic category is associated with a specific pattern of learning difficulties, caused by a distinctive neurocognitive foundation. As a result, researchers have spent decades searching for causal, ‘core’ deficits for each diagnostic group. The hope is that unlocking an underlying mechanism will lead to downstream benefits in learning and life chances. This quest has been largely unsuccessful. Purportedly ‘core’ deficits are remarkably inconsistent, interventions targeting them do not yield cascading benefits, and supposedly ‘unique’ challenges are frequently found across multiple diagnostic groups, and in children with no diagnosis. The fundamental problem is the assumption of diagnostic ground truth is not valid. In fact, any system that assigns young people to discrete categories fails to capture the complexity of development. Moreover, this assumption has hampered our efforts to understand underlying brain and cognitive mechanisms, because it has shifted our attention towards explaining diagnosis and away from understanding the common barriers that young people face in everyday life. The current proposal marks a radical departure from the assumption of diagnostic ground truth. We will use a JSMF Opportunity Award as a springboard to a new theoretical framework, that embraces complexity in neurodevelopment.  By applying innovative data-driven and complex modelling techniques we will make new discoveries about the nature of, and barriers to, learning. Two linked projects will build a hierarchical framework in which surface level characteristics (e.g. language difficulties) can have diverse origins at multiple levels (genetic, neurological, cognitive). The first project uses existing large-scale datasets, in tandem with recent advances in data modelling, to map characteristics across these levels. The second project picks up on these mappings and builds a new theoretical model using generative network modelling. To date, most theories of neurodevelopment are descriptive accounts of groups of individuals, weaving together average characteristics with a narrative theory of their shared origins. In contrast, the second project will bring about a step-change in theoretical approach by building generative models of neurodevelopment. In simulating the growth of a connectome, this approach can capture complexity, model developmental processes, and link multiple datatypes (e.g. incorporating genetics). Our long-term goal is not only to make discoveries to benefit the lives of young people experiencing barriers to learning, but to bring about a step-change in approach within the wider field. The work afforded by a JSMF Opportunity Award will act as a beacon for research in neurodevelopment.

The use of 2D environments affords experimenters careful control and has led to the discovery of fundamental principles, such as how attention modulates sensory processing and gates awareness [1-4]. In the memory literature, the pervasive use of lists of objects or words has similarly elucidated central properties of memory processes and representations [5, 6]. However, these approaches are inherently limited because real-world behaviors are defined by the need to control attention over time in changing environments where memory, sensation, and action interact recursively [7, 8]. From this perspective, research to date provides limited insight on how attention and memory interact to drive behaviors in the real world, and how these interactions change from childhood into adulthood. The necessity of observing individuals in naturalistic settings to discover how learning occurs is underscored by recent advances in developmental psychology demonstrating that infants’ visual explorations in natural settings create unique opportunities for optimal learning through interactions with objects and people [9, 10]. Virtual reality (VR) technology holds the promise to achieve the ideal combination of providing individuals with immersive naturalistic experiences and allowing the experimenter to retain the methodological rigor of traditional laboratory research. VR has already been used extensively as a proxy for real world situations with subjective reports of behavioral realism [11-13]. We propose to develop VR games to address two main questions:  1) How do attention and memory interactions unfold dynamically and recursively in naturalistic environments? and, 2) How does this interactive process evolve from middle childhood to early adulthood (8-25 years of age)? We are guided by the overarching hypothesis that the dynamic experiences in novel environments will promote optimal interactions between attention and learning, and that these interactions can be quantified with indices of continued information extraction and memory retention that cannot be obtained in the laboratory. We expect age-related improvements in the processes contributing to the efficiency of attention-memory interactions. These improvements may be particularly pronounced when children are required to identify moments in space and time in which distraction may be uniquely detrimental. Conversely, attention and memory interactions in children may be particularly advantaged under conditions in which they can self-direct their explorations. By combining continuous measures of eye-gaze and action responses with naturalistic and traditional memory tasks, we will be able to discover principles of how attention, learning, and memory, interact to guide behavior during exploration of new environments, exploitation of recurring environments, and incidental learning. We will increase ecological validity while gaining the opportunity to ask new questions, the answer of which we hope will transform our understanding of visual attention and its interaction with memory in children and adults.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California, Davis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2020-1251', 'year': '2020', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This work\nfalls within a research tradition in which normative models (which specify how ideal actors should\nbehave) are compared with descriptive theories of behavior (which specify how real actors do behave).\nOver the last forty years, psychologists have compiled a lengthy catalogue of descriptive violations of the\ntraditional theory of rational choice. The human decision maker (DM) one meets in the psychological literature is capricious and\nmalleable. Subtle changes in framing (how options are described), procedure (how evaluations are\nelicited), and context (which other options are considered) are shown to trigger dramatic swings in\nexpressed preference. Nonetheless, while preferences are often inconsistent across choice episodes,\npeople strive to maintain consistency within episodes  – a phenomenon known as .\nThese findings suggest that preferences are “constructed,” rather than revealed, in the act of choice, and\nare often seen as decisive demonstrations of irrationality. My research explores the construction of preference from a different perspective. I argue that an\nadequate normative analysis depends on subtle assumptions that are often overlooked. To\nformulate a normative theory, we need to understand the structure of the DM’s values. To test the theory,\nwe need to understand the DM’s dynamically evolving beliefs about the choice situation. What is rational\ndepends on what is sought and what is known. My goal is to incorporate a richer and more realistic\ndescriptive assessment of values and knowledge into the psychological study of human rationality. I\nfocus on the ramifications of imperfect knowledge and incompletely specified values. When knowledge is limited, learning and decision making are intimately intertwined. The menu\nof options serves as a sample from an unfamiliar world, and the rational DM may update her beliefs, and\nhence her preferences, as new options are sampled. The normative analysis of choice then requires an\nempirical analysis of the information structure of the environment, the manner in which beliefs are\nupdated as it is explored, and the effects of these inferences on preferences. My research aims to map out\nthis information structure, and to clarify its implications for effects of framing, procedure, and context. When underlying values are not defined to infinite precision, choice – rational or otherwise – is\nan inherently constructive activity. Importantly, it can be shown that local consistency is valuable even\nwhen individual decisions are globally arbitrary. Furthermore, when memory limits constrain the degree\nof consistency that can be maintained, a bias to favor the status quo (which is ubiquitous in human\ndecision making and usually regarded as counter-normative) may be advantageous. This analysis\nsuggests a new perspective on the psychology and rationality of coherent arbitrariness. This program of research explores the unexpectedly complex interplay between normative and\ndescriptive levels of analysis. A rational analysis depends on subtle empirical assumptions concerning\nthe structure of human beliefs and values.

What triggers a rise in\nblood glucose in the morning? How do viruses spread? A fundamental goal of most sciences is discovering the rules behind why things happen. To\nsuccessfully interact with the world by predicting future events, explaining the occurrence of\nphenomena, and intervening to produce particular outcomes, we cannot simply describe a\nsystem behaves, we must know it behaves as it does. Say we learn that seizures and poor stroke outcomes are associated. If this correlation is due to\nan unmeasured cause of both, then outcome predictions based solely on seizures can fail\nunexpectedly. If seizures are predictive of a poor outcome just because they tell us about the\nseverity of brain injury, then we cannot explain a patient’s outcome as being due to seizures.\nFurther, an intervention treating the seizures not only may not improve outcomes but may also\ncause harm (due to the side effects of medication). Beyond the need for causality, patients are highly complex systems that pose many challenges\nfor traditional causal inference methods. The body’s various subsystems are densely\ninterconnected and affected by properties of the whole; they are robust and contain backup\nmechanisms; and they change at many timescales. Depending on the level of temporal\ngranularity, a seemingly nonstationary system may actually be cyclic (e.g. circadian rhythm), and\nnew causal relationships may emerge over time in response to environmental triggers. To face this challenge one might look to the field of complex systems. However, this research\nhas often focused on networks (without causality) or complex causal relationships between two\nvariables (ignoring large densely connected structures), which can find spurious relationships\nbetween effects of a common cause (such as yellowed fingers causing lung cancer if both are due\nto smoking). At the same time, computational methods for causal inference have not been able to\nhandle complex systems, focusing instead on simple relationships between individual variables. This work aims to unite causality and complex systems to address two key questions whose\nanswers will advance computation, biomedical applications, and philosophy. First, what are the elements of a causal relationship and how can we discover these\nautomatically? Instead of limiting inference to user-defined sets of variables, we aim to discover\nrelationships involving system properties and ultimately to find what causes a causal relationship\nto emerge. This means we will be able to find relationships like “when homeostasis of the brain\nis disrupted after a stroke, new compensatory links are created that bypass affected systems.” Second, systems are organized on multiple spatial and temporal levels, but how do these\ninteract? Rather than abstracting data to the same timescale or understanding these in\ndisconnected ways, we will develop methods for inferring the temporal and spatial relationships\nbetween cause and effect.

In poll after poll,\nmillions of people have been shown to believe that dinosaurs coexisted with humans, that the\nearth’s continents are fixed in place, and that the sun orbits the earth. Likewise, millions are\nskeptical that genetically modified foods are safe to eat, that climate change is caused by\nhumans, and that humans evolved from non-human ancestors. Public ignorance of science stems\nfrom a number of factors, but one factor that plagues our understanding of all domains of science\nis a reliance on intuitive theories. Intuitive theories are untutored explanations for how the world\nworks. They are our best guess as to why we observe the events we do and how we can intervene\non the world to change the outcomes of those events—events as diverse as freezing, floating,\nfalling, rotting, breeding, bleeding, growing, and dying. The world is a complex place, and we\nhave devised our own homespun theories for explaining that complexity. Three decades of research in cognitive development and science education have revealed much\nabout the content and structure of intuitive theories across several domains of knowledge. Less is\nknown, however, about the fate of those theories after we have acquired a scientific theory of the\nsame domain. Indeed, recent research from my lab and others suggests that intuitive theories are\nnot replaced by scientific theories but instead coexist with those theories, influencing our\ninferences about the natural world for decades to follow. Most educated adults know that the\nmoon orbits the earth and that the earth orbits the sun, but, when asked to verify those facts under\ntime pressure, we verify the latter more slowly and less accurately than the former, presumably\nbecause we have always believed that the moon orbits the earth but had to learn that the earth\norbits the sun and not vice versa. Both beliefs accord with science but only one accords with\nintuition. These findings imply that our understanding of science is constrained by pre-scientific intuitions\nnot only when learning science but also when reasoning about science later in life. I plan to\ninvestigate this phenomenon on two fronts. On one front, I plan to investigate whether, and how,\nintuitive theories change in the face of a scientific alternative. What factors maintain intuitive\ntheories across the lifespan? And what factors influence whether we deploy intuitive theories or\nscientific theories when reasoning about phenomena covered by both? On another front, I plan to\ninvestigate the role of cognitive reflection in understanding and endorsing scientific ideas. At\nwhat point in the development of cognitive reflection are children most receptive to scientific\nideas? And how do individual differences in adults’ disposition toward cognitive reflection\ninfluence their receptiveness to scientific ideas?

Throughout the history of Cognitive Science, scholars have wondered about the nature of imagery: what does it mean to perceive something that isn’t actually there? How does that perception compare to the perception you would have if it there? And, most importantly, ? The majority of imagery studies have focused on the modality, on whether people generate pictorial representations of images. My work, in contrast, explores auditory imagery through the lens of human language. To study the psychological representations of auditory imagery, I investigate sound representations generated during silent reading. Language presents an excellent case study for auditory imagery in that it can be transmitted via two modalities: vision (reading) and audition (speaking). In my lab, we compare the cognitive processing of language in the visual modality to the same messages in the auditory modality. Finding similarities between these processes suggests similarities between auditory imagery and auditory perception. In one series of studies, I demonstrated that readers had difficulty when they read words that didn’t conform to an overall imagined sentence rhythm (e.g., they were expecting and they read ). In another, I observed reading slowdowns when readers encountered CAPS on a word that would not be accented if spoken aloud. I argue from these results that readers are experiencing auditory imagery during reading— that reading silently activates sound representations of words and sentences. Moreover, my data demonstrate that auditory imagery affects language understanding . That is, the auditory images themselves have consequences for language understanding. In current work, I am investigating how auditory imagery during reading is like auditory perception. Planned studies will adapt methods developed to investigate visual imagery, which have demonstrated processing overlap between imagery and perception. In one series of studies, I am recording event‐related potentials (ERPs) from the scalps of participants who are reading or listening to spoken language. I will compare these datasets to identify overlap in the neural signal between reading and listening; moreover, building on prior ERP studies on perception and memory, I will explore how these basic cognitive processes might contribute to imagery. In a second series of studies, I am investigating individual differences in auditory imagery during silent reading. This work builds on demonstrations of correlations between participants’ self‐reported imagery vividness, and the strength of imagery‐contingent behavioral effects. By exploring the similarities between perception and imagery, research in my lab addresses foundational questions in cognitive science about the nature of mental representations. In addition, the proposed research program will have application for reading instruction. Results from these studies may shed light on the established yet unexplained relationship between children’s fluency in reading aloud and their silent reading comprehension ability. It may be the case that beginning readers who read aloud with appropriate prosody—that is, their phrasing and accents reflect the meaning of the sentence—also read silently with appropriate prosody, thereby enhancing their understanding of syntax and semantics and their overall sentence comprehension.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Mount Holyoke College', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020431\\n', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These findings have led to the predominant view that chronic stress impairs cognition. However, this is not the whole story. I recently theorized and provided evidence showing that these same individuals may also develop enhanced cognitive abilities for solving problems in high-adversity contexts. This specialization hypothesis predicts that people from harsh environments might show improved performance on tasks matching recurrent problems in those environments. One goal of my research is to test this prediction in people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, and to uncover a high-resolution map of the cognitive skills and abilities of stress-adapted youth and adults. This work has broad social implications: the better we understand stress-adapted minds, bodies, and brains—including their strengths—the more effectively we can tailor education, jobs, and interventions to fit their needs and potentials. My research program is premised on the principle that organisms adapt to their environments over multiple timescales: across generations by natural selection, and within lifetimes through development and learning. These processes are nested. That is, natural selection results in developmental and learning systems, which in turn tailor individuals to their physical and social environments based on experience (including adverse ones). Individuals also select and create their own environments, altering current ecologies and modifying selection pressures on future generations. In my theoretical research, I use mathematical modeling to study these interrelated processes. Development and evolution are inextricably linked. All phenotypes result from development. Therefore, natural selection can only shape phenotypes by modifying developmental systems, i.e., the array of factors and processes that give rise to phenotypes. This insight has deep implications. For example, rather than viewing ‘human nature’ as a fixed set of traits universally shared among all members of a species, we may conceive of human nature as a composite of interacting developmental systems. Key questions include: how does natural selection shape developmental and learning mechanisms depending on environmental conditions? How do these mechanisms adapt individuals to local conditions based on experience? Modeling these questions provides insight into species-typical development, individual differences, and cultural variation. In the coming years, I will extend my theoretical research by making the statistical structure of the environment in my models more dynamic, creating scope for learning on shorter timescales. I will achieve this by including reinforcement learning into my models, thus integrating three adaptive processes: evolution, development, and learning. This research will unify processes operating on different timescales into a single coherent framework. Scholars working in related fields benefit from each other’s work. In my developmental studies of human cognition and behavior, I draw on ideas, methods, and findings from diverse fields, including evolutionary biology, animal behavior, anthropology, and machine learning, and share the fruits of my labor with these fields.

A crucial reason is that her perceptual systems are unable to process the barrage of new information that she is receiving. We now know that, over the first years of life, experience tunes infant perceptual systems to their environment. However, we do not yet know the underlying mechanisms of this crucial developmental process. The overarching goal of my research is to elucidate how an infant leverages her experience into changes in her perceptual abilities. My work focuses on how infants use top-down information (i.e., coming from outside the perceptual system in question) to influence the development of their perceptual abilities. This represents a divergence from current approaches that consider perceptual development as a predominantly isolated, bottom-up process. This new approach to perceptual development dovetails with recent advances in cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience that have elucidated that the adult brain is a highly dynamic system with largescale neural networks and long-range connections. These networks permit the flow of information in many directions, including top-down information feeding-back to perceptual systems. These discoveries have precipitated a shift from considering perception as being a reactive or passive system to considering perception as a predictive or active system that uses the current state of information to predict future input. To investigate whether and how perceptual development is supported by top-down processes, I have been studying sensory prediction in young infants. Sensory prediction requires top-down connections into the perceptual system and, thus, it is an important window into the role of top-down information on infant perception. To this end, my work employs a combination of novel behavioral paradigms and neuroimaging methods such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to localize neural activity in perceptual systems. Using this approach, I have established that by 6 months, infants are capable of using nascent top-down connections to engage in sensory prediction. Building from this foundation, my ongoing research is determining the role of top-down processing in perceptual development. I have been systematically investigating the functional or behavioral consequences of sensory prediction for young infants and how these processes may relate to broader developmental trajectories in perceptual development through studying individual differences and at-risk groups.

Acquiring culture-specific systems of social classification is a challenging learning problem with far-reaching cognitive, developmental, and social consequences.

A long-term goal of this research program is to capitalize on this knowledge to understand how to prevent some of the pernicious consequences of social categorization, while still facilitating its benefits for development and social interaction. To examine how representations of social categories develop and shape cognition and behavior, my research over the next several years will focus on addressing two main questions. First, I aim to reveal the processes that underlie the development of representations of the social world and how they relate to those that operate in other conceptual domains. As part of this work, I will examine the specific structure of children's representations—including the extent to which children view particular categories as reflecting objective structure in the environment, as marking coherent kinds, and as playing a causal-explanatory role in individual behavior. Further, as part of this line of research, I will ask how particular aspects of experience give rise to each of these components of conceptual representation, and test the broader cognitive and behavioral consequences of each. Second, I will focus on understanding how and why language leads children to view particular criteria as marking meaningful differences between people. Ultimately, my research will build on these insights to develop new approaches for preventing some of the pernicious consequences of social categorization (e.g., to reduce stereotyping, prejudice, and inter-group conflict), while still promoting some of its benefits (e.g., fostering feelings of affiliation, cooperation, and facilitating smooth inter-group interactions by allowing children to recognize and appreciate diverse social norms and beliefs). My research combines multiple methods, including examination of children's representations of various social groupings (e.g., gender, race, religion, ethnicity) across different ages, populations, and developmental experiences; experimental tests of learning processes in single session laboratory and short-term longitudinal designs; and analysis of parental language in experimental and more naturalistic contexts.

Children learn one or more languages, acquire categories and complex concepts, and generate a broad understanding of the world. Given that children’s early experiences are the foundation for their later learning, researchers, including myself, have sought to elucidate the mechanisms that allow children to learn from these experiences. My research approach to studying children’s word, category, and concept learning is two-fold. First, I use a bottom-up approach to understand cognitive development. That is, I have been interested in how basic cognitive processes, such as attention and memory mechanisms, give rise to the emergence of higher-order cognition. Children enter the world with only basic cognitive capacities; my work has sought to understand how these basic capacities are used as building blocks for later learning. My work has shown that lower-level processes that historically have been argued to be constraints on cognition are actually critical mechanisms for facilitating cognitive development. For instance, forgetting has been argued to constrain children’s learning, but my research has demonstrated that forgetting drives the abstraction of relevant and irrelevant information. The second part of my research approach is to examine interactions between learning words and categories. That is, once children learn new words, how does this affect the development of higher-order cognition? My general hypothesis is this: words have inductive potential; learning words can help children to acquire new categories and concepts which, in turn, helps them learn more words. For example, knowing “color” may help children learn the words for specific colors, but it may also help them induce color as a relevant grouping dimension on a nonverbal task. These word and category learning processes result in bi-directional interactions in the development of higher-order cognition. My future work will use several research methods to study lower-level processes in word, category, and concept learning, and interactions of higher-order cognition. My lab will tap into what and how children learned with a multi-method approach, such as by behavioral testing, standardized testing, longitudinal studies, and eye-tracking. Critically, my lab will focus on developing new technologies for answering questions that require fine-grained, day-to-day learning trajectories in language and cognitive development. For instance, my colleagues and I are designing an app that will allow parents, teachers, and clinicians to document milestones in language and cognitive development, such as when children first comprehend or produce new words. The long-term goal of this work is to make the app freely available to the public, eventually leading to a large data corpus from which researchers can answer long-standing questions in language and thought.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Wisconsin - Madison', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020551\\n', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Still, humans are remarkably efficient at processing numbers. Indeed, we are so familiar with numbers that we exhibit numerical Stroop effects: when asked to determine which of two digits is physically larger, educated adults are slower and less accurate when the physically smaller digit has the larger numerical value. This means humans are so competent with numbers that we automatically process their magnitudes (or sizes), even when they are irrelevant to the task at hand. How is it that the human brain can support such fluid processing of numerical symbols when it clearly did not evolve to do so? What basic capacities existed that have been recycled to form a basis for supporting number concepts? My research seeks to uncover answers to these questions, particularly as they apply to fractions and other numbers that cannot be reached by counting. One frequently proffered answer regarding the origins of our number sense points to some basic perceptual abilities that allow humans and other species to rapidly estimate the sizes of sets of discrete objects. One such ability, subitizing, allows us to rapidly and exactly enumerate small sets of objects. Another, the approximate number system (or ANS), allows us to rapidly determine the approximate sizes of much larger sets (e.g., an array of sixty dots). Several researchers have argued that the acquisition of numerical concepts rests upon these evolutionarily inherited enumeration abilities that serve as “neurocognitive startup tools” for number concepts. These theorists privilege whole numbers, concluding that other classes of numbers, such as fractions and irrational numbers, exceed the innate constraints of these core abilities. Thus, the countable numbers have been dubbed the “natural” numbers, and others are deemed the products of human artifice, as exemplified by the mathematician Kronecker’s famous proclamation that, “God made the integers; all the rest is the work of man” (Bell, 1986, p. 477). My work investigates an alternative to these innate constraints accounts of the human number sense. Specifically, I and others have begun to detail the human ability to perceptually access the magnitudes of nonsymbolic ratio magnitudes (i.e., ratios composed of pairs of nonsymbolic stimuli, such as two line segments with lengths in a 2:3 ratio). This work stands to contribute to basic science and to applied education research in multiple ways. First, it extends accounts of the primitive human number sense to include relationally defined magnitudes, like fractions. Second, it seeks to situate theories of numerical processing into theories regarding human perception of size more generally, be it the number of dots in an array, the area of a circle, or the loudness of a sound. Finally, it offers new hypotheses on how educators might rely on this basic perceptual ability to improve instruction about important concepts like fractions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Wisconsin - Madison', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020553\\n', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

They argue about which pile of candy has the most and who should get it. They count their fingers, number of people in the family, and spaces on board games. However, already by school entry, children display striking individual differences in these skills, and delays can set them on a path for low math performance, lower income, and lower chances of full-time employment later in life. But what are the origins for these individual differences? My research focuses on the development of mathematical thinking in early childhood, specifically how complex mathematical thinking builds upon ontogenetically earlier number concepts and the mechanisms that shape this development. To this end, I use behavioral measures drawing from experimental designs and observational techniques typical for cognitive and developmental psychology, standardized assessments relevant for education, and brain imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous research has shown that intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence children’s math abilities. On the one hand, children’s intuitive number sense, i.e., their ability to rapidly approximate the number of objects in a set without counting them, predicts their math abilities later in life. For example, my collaborators and I showed that infants’ intuitive number sense predicts their performance on a standardized math assessment during the preschool years. On the other hand, the math-related learning opportunities that children experience in their environment, especially at home and in their preschools, are linked with their math abilities. For example, we showed that the frequency with which parents talk about numbers when playing with their children predicts children’s math abilities. Thus, variability in young children’s math abilities seems to be driven both by intrinsic variations in foundational number skills and math-related environmental input. Interestingly, parents’ own intuitive number sense and their math abilities correlate with their children’s math abilities and how frequently they engage in math talk with their children suggesting a complex relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A key focus of my on-going and future work is to identify the psychological prerequisites and biological foundations on which mathematical abilities are built, the child’s own contributions to the construction of mathematical knowledge, and the necessary social input from parents and early childhood educators that gives rise to the emergence of mathematical thinking. The overarching goal of my work is to further our theoretical understanding of the development of early mathematical cognition, to use this knowledge to improve children’s math abilities through targeted interventions, and to ultimately increase students’ prospects for academic success in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

Despite what seems to be a daunting flood of information, children learn quickly and efficiently about their worlds. My laboratory seeks to understand how this prodigious learning takes place. The focus of our work is early word learning, a domain in which children achieve remarkable feats of learning (the average six-year-old knows 14,000 words) and a topic that lies at the cross-sections of cognitive, social and language development. The fact that early word learning is marked by large individual differences with clinical, educational, and societal implications highlights the importance of understanding its underlying processes. The central aim of our research over the next several years is to investigate how early learning experiences shape word learning. Although there is general agreement that experience matters for later learning and development, through what mechanisms those experiences lead to robust learning is not well understood. Three related lines of research form our agenda in the coming years. First, we will investigate the inter-connections between different dimensions of early language learning experiences (the quantity and quality of child-directed speech, parental responsivity in early conversations, the perceptual transparency of referents, etc.). The inter- connections between these dimensions create conceptual and methodological barriers for understanding how early experience shapes learning. The proposed research seeks to bring these issues to the forefront and to work towards a framework for meeting these challenges. A second goal of our research is to understand the interaction dynamics that give rise to individual differences in language learning experiences. Individual differences in global-level metrics of early language experience (e.g., the amount and types of speech heard) are well- established predictors of children’s language development. These differences however, accrue over many individual interactions and conversations. Through investigating the real-time dynamics of how individual conversations are initiated, how turn-taking within a conversation is maintained, and how conversational topics shift and stay, we will come to understand with more precision where those highly predictive global-level metrics come from. The final goal of our research is to examine the well-established relationship between early experiences and later learning through a computational lens. By attempting to simulate and re-create within different computational frameworks the observed link between input (early experiences) and output (later learning patterns), we hope to shed light on the possible mechanisms by which early experiences relate to learning, as well as to offer concrete hypotheses for the types of real-world input-output relationships one should expect under different frameworks of learning. In pursuing these lines of research, my laboratory will bring together different theoretical and methodological approaches, investigate how experiences change as a function of development and context, as well as examine how both children and their caregivers shape early learning.

Children’s rapid vocabulary development is striking given the learning challenges they face. Discerning a new word’s meaning is a daunting task, since words are typically uttered in complex scenes in which they could have many possible interpretations. Compounding this problem, children often have to learn multiple meanings for each word, because most words in language are polysemous: they express a family of related meanings. For example, the English word chicken labels an animal, a kind of meat, a game, and a cowardly person. Is it difficult for children to learn a new word when it carries multiple meanings? According to almost all current theories, it should be. This is because polysemous words violate a core assumption that is thought to guide learning, namely, that a single word should map onto a single category of meaning. In contrast, my research program advances the opposite view. I propose that polysemy is widespread in language because it facilitates learning. Considering how children learn polysemous words transforms our understanding of the basic mechanisms that drive learning, and provides insight into a major question in developmental science: how children learn so much within such a brief period of time. My research proposes that children not only have the capacity to learn multiple meanings for a word, but can also leverage their knowledge of one word meaning to make inferences about— and even anticipate—its other meanings. Thus, rather than impeding learning, polysemy allows children to learn-to-learn, building on their initial knowledge of a word to guess its other meanings. From this perspective, polysemy arises in the lexicon in response to the pressure to make language maximally learnable. Polysemy thus provides an example of how language—as a culturally-transmitted system—has been adapted to fit how even the youngest minds make sense of the world. I test these hypotheses through several lines of work, using experimental methods with children and computational analyses of large-scale linguistic corpora. First, I explore whether children have difficulty learning polysemous words, as predicted by current theories. Second, I examine ways in which polysemy might instead facilitate word learning. Finally, I explore the origins of polysemy, by tracing how polysemy has developed over history and across languages. Because most words are polysemous, children will often be learning a new meaning of a word for which they have already learned a prior meaning. The acquisition of polysemous words thus provides an understudied example of how development builds on itself, as prior learning supports and constrains future learning. With support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation, I will extend my research to elucidate these developmental processes. Specifically, I will explore (1) how children make sense of polysemy early in life and develop knowledge of polysemy from their language environments, and (2) whether learning polysemous words might scaffold not only language development but also cognitive development, by prompting children to learn more about the world around them.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Berkeley', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020548', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

How are we shaped by our environments, and how do constraints on human developmental, social and cognitive behaviors shape the environment from which we learn? To understand the role of the environment in cognitive development is to understand which properties of the environment are essential for healthy development, to understand which aspects of development are malleable, and to understand how the environment might drive developmental change and new knowledge. I will address these questions with respect to language development in children. My focus is not on simply collecting new data about the environment, but on conceptual, methodological and mathematical advances that will enable us to ask and better answer questions about the massive scale of everyday experience. The fields of cognitive science and cognitive development are at an exciting point in time with respect to questions about the learning environment. Wearable sensors, recording devices, machine learning and computing power are allowing researchers to collect and analyze naturalistic datasets more easily and on a larger scale than ever before. The transformative potential of large, naturalistic datasets is particularly evident in the field of language development. These advances have powerful implications for healthy childhood development, because both the quantity and quantity of language are strong predictors of language development, as well as later achievements across many different domains, including formal education and reading. Analyses of large, naturalistic datasets will fundamentally change our beliefs about what language is, how it is learned, the input language upon which language learning operates, and what is unique versus common across individual children’s development. My research program has three broad goals. These goals have implications not only for understanding the mechanisms that underlie language development, but also for understanding how the early language environment prepares the child for subsequent learning. First, to understand the best ways to analyze large, naturalistic language data sets. This includes best practices in data sampling, and gaining an understanding of the sources of variability between and within individuals, and how to best operationalize those dimensions of the input in data analyses. Second, to understand the contribution of contexts (e.g., breakfast-time, dinnertime, storytime) to our measurements of language input, how different contexts vary from each other, and vary from the rest of the day. Third, to develop better links between aspects of children’s language environments and learning outcomes. This includes understanding how shifts in the language environment might predict different learning outcomes, as well as understanding how distributional differences across individuals or across items (e.g., words, categories, sentences) might predict learning outcomes in those individuals or items. This research will advance the field’s best practices for sampling and analyzing large naturalistic datasets in ways that are consistent with both the mathematical properties of language distributions and the reality of children’s day-to-day experiences with language.

In other words, is there a sensible\r\nnotion of “dimensionality reduction” for complex systems? Surely ‘low-dimensional’ and ‘complex’\r\nare antithetical, right? I suspect not. About 5 years ago, Terrence Tao received a Fields Medal for groundbreaking work on the\r\nrepresentation of signals using a concept called sparsity. Sparsity embodies the notion that quite\r\noften very complex (and high-bandwidth) signals can be represented as a combination of surprisingly\r\nfew basis vectors. This observation enables one to completely side-step the well-known Nyquist\r\nSampling Theorem, which states that, in order to be able to reproduce a signal from discretely\r\nsampled data, one must sample the signal at a rate that is at least twice that of the highest\r\nfrequency present in the signal. But does this potentially transformative theory work in practice? Indeed: sparsity has been\r\nconcretely instantiated through the creation of the new field of Compressive Sensing (Candes and\r\nWakin, 2008), which is built around the notion of sparsity. The idea was popularized by the\r\ninvention of a “single pixel camera” – a concept developed by researchers at Rice University, in\r\nwhich they built a digital camera that takes a surprisingly small number of random one dimensional (i.e. single pixel) projections of the scene. Using these “one pixel images”, the researchers\r\ndemonstrated the successful recovery of a photographic image. This achievement required solving a\r\nseemingly ill-posed inverse problem, rendered solvable by using the Tao's sparsity constraint. This\r\nand other applications to medical image reconstruction, computer vision and machine learning have\r\ndemonstrated the extraordinary applicability of the theory of sparse representations to real-world\r\nproblems and data. What does sparsity have to do with dynamical systems in general, and complex systems in\r\nparticular? To date, almost nothing: on the one hand, sparsity has been applied almost exclusively\r\nto static linear problems, while on the other hand, the complexity of dynamical systems is typically\r\ncharacterized in terms of the number of independent variables in a nonlinear model. With help from my collaborator Rene Vidal, I propose a research\r\nprogram to advance the theory of sparse representations in the context of dynamics as a new\r\napproach to dimensionality reduction in complex systems. This will lead to a new theory of sparse\r\nrepresentation of dynamical systems, predicated on the existence of unknown but sparse (and\r\nswitched) inputs to a dynamical system. While the principal aims of this work are theoretical in nature, I find it essential to ground\r\nthis theory by testing it against data from natural systems. Specifically, I choose animal behavior\r\n(including human behavior) for empirical testing. My goal is to create a program at the intersection\r\nof dynamical systems theory and experimental animal behavior. I will achieve this research program\r\nby building upon existing collaborations with experimental biologists, and branching into the realm\r\nof cooperative (social) animal behavior. Through these collaborations I will have access to wide-\r\nranging behavioral data sets which I can use to test the basic theories that I will develop under a\r\nJames S. McDonnell Scholar Award. My goal is to develop a new theory of sparse dynamical systems, develop statistical techniques\r\nto identify their structure from data, and apply this new theory to decipher some of the most\r\ncomplex systems in existence: naturally behaving animals.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Johns Hopkins University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020323\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Glioblastoma\r\nmultiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive manifestation of glioma, with roughly 15,000 new cases diagnosed\r\nannually in the United States. The median survival for GBM ranges between 12-15 months despite maximum\r\ntreatment efforts -- a devastating statistic that has changed little over several decades of technological\r\nadvances in neurosurgery, radiation therapy and clinical trials of conventional and novel therapeutics. It is\r\nperplexing that therapies used effectively in the treatment of other solid tumors, such as breast, lung and\r\nprostate, are overwhelmingly ineffective in the treatment of GBM. Thus, there is a desperate need for more\r\neffective, novel therapeutic approaches to improve the clinical outcome of patients with this aggressive disease. On the basis of clinical presentation, GBMs can be subdivided into two subtypes: primary or secondary.\r\nPrimary GBMs account for the great majority of cases in older patients, while secondary GBMs are more rare,\r\nand tend to occur in patients below the age of 45 years. Primary GBM presents in an acute manner with no\r\nevidence of prior symptoms or precursor lower grade pathology. In contrast, secondary GBM derives\r\nconsistently from lower grade disease which progresses over the course of 5-10 years from the time of\r\ndiagnosis. Remarkably, despite these distinct clinical histories, primary and secondary GBMs are clinically\r\nindistinguishable after diagnosis as reflected by their equally poor prognosis. Like all cancers, GBMs of both the primary and secondary type are caused by mutations or alterations\r\nin genes that control the normal growth of the cells from which they arise. These affected genes can be\r\nclassified into two broad categories, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These two genes types can\r\nbest be described by comparison to the accelerator and brakes of a car, where oncogenes typically act as the\r\ngas or accelerator of tumor cell growth and survival, and tumor suppressor genes act as the brake on tumor\r\ncell growth and survival. The combination of mutations in both types of genes within the same cell has the\r\ngreatest effect on promoting aggressive tumor growth, as acceleration of tumor growth is left undaunted by the\r\nbrakes to slow it down. For example, the gene that encodes a molecule known as epidermal growth factor\r\nreceptor (EGFR) is commonly expressed at very high levels (amplified) or mutated in GBM and thus promotes\r\ntumor growth acceleration through activation of a complex network of molecules, the chief of which is an\r\nenzyme, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K). In contrast, PI3-K is kept under tight control by a tumor\r\nsuppressor gene that codes for the phosphatase and tensin (PTEN) protein. If EGFR is mutated and becomes\r\nhighly active (gas is applied), it can accelerate tumor cell growth. If the tumor cell also becomes mutated for\r\nPTEN (removing the brake), this combination of elevated EGFR activity and defective PTEN cooperate to\r\ndramatically enhance tumor aggressiveness. It is this EGFR/PTEN accelerator/brake circuit that has received considerable attention in the field of\r\nGBM therapeutics. A range of potential therapies that target EGFR or a mutant, highly oncogenic form of\r\nEGFR specific to GBM, have been developed. Examples of therapies that are currently in development or in\r\nclinical trials for the treatment of this disease are inhibitors that block the activity of the receptor, in essence\r\nremoving the accelerator (tyrosine kinase inhibitors; TKIs); antibodies that bind to the receptor; and vaccines\r\nthat prompt an immunological response targeting GBM cells expressing the receptor. Data from experimental\r\nstudies evaluating these therapies, in particular, TKIs, have been very promising; however, their efficacy in the\r\nclinic has so far been limited. Some of the documented mechanisms that tumors use to cause resistance to EGFR TKIs include the\r\nacquisition of changes in the EGFR protein that blocks drug binding, compensatory elevated expression of\r\nother growth factor receptors that function similar to EGFR but are different enough proteins that the EGFRspecific\r\ndrug doesn't bind to them, activation of molecules that pump the TKI out of the tumor cell, or the existence of minor populations of cancer cells that are inherently resistant to a broad spectrum of therapeutics.\r\nSeveral of these mechanisms have been firmly established for cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer and\r\nbreast cancer. In GBM, several labs have shown that expression of mutated EGFR coupled with mutation of\r\nPTEN is a major mechanism that confers poor clinical responses to EGFR TKIs, in essence because the brake\r\nthat blocks EGFR-mediated activation of PI3-K has been compromised. Unfortunately, tumors with activated\r\nEGFR and intact, non-mutated PTEN tend to show only modest or short-lived treatment responses, pointing to\r\nthe existence of additional mechanisms that promote drug resistance. This raises the question-- are there mechanisms that an EGFR-expressing tumor cell might use that\r\nmimic the mutation of PTEN? In other words, PTEN is retained in the tumor cell, but fails to exert its normal\r\nfunctions. In an effort toward understanding this phenomenon of PTEN retention coupled with EGFR TKI\r\nresistance, my laboratory has sought to determine if the PTEN brake has been compromised through a\r\nmutation-independent mechanism. By analyzing the PTEN protein in cell lines derived from GBM patient\r\nsamples, we have in fact identified a unique mechanism whereby PTEN is modified by phosphorylation, an\r\nalteration found on many proteins that regulates diverse features, such as its activity, its localization in the cell,\r\nand its rate of degradation. In the case of PTEN, phosphorylation occurred on a specific amino acid of the\r\nprotein, a tyrosine located at position 240 in the chain of 403 amino acids that make up the PTEN protein.\r\nUsing an antibody that we developed as a tool to detect PTEN tyrosine 240 phosphorylation, we determined\r\nthat in addition to loss or mutation of PTEN, its phosphorylation at tyrosine 240 is linked to very poor prognosis\r\nand EGFR TKI resistance in GBM patients. Further analysis of these patient samples revealed that an\r\nadditional growth factor receptor known as fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) was expressed in EGFR\r\nTKI resistant, PTEN-expressing tumor cells and subsequent experimentation showed this receptor to be\r\ndirectly responsible for causing the phosphorylation of PTEN and promoting EGFR TKI resistance. These\r\nfindings show that this specific FGFR-prompted modification of PTEN causes this tumor suppressor to\r\nmalfunction, similar to having grease on a brake pad. Given the above findings, we predict that restoration of PTEN's normal function, which would be akin\r\nthe cleaning of grease from the brake pads, should be possible in GBMs where PTEN is tyrosine\r\nphosphorylated by FGFR. This could be achieved by using inhibitors targeting FGFR, which would block\r\nphosphorylation of PTEN's tyrosine 240, and in conjunction with co-administration of an EGFR TKI, we should\r\nbe able to overcome drug resistance in a GBM patient that fits this profile. Targeted therapies are an important new class of agents for the treatment of GBM patients. Based on\r\nthe previously defined PTEN deletion mechanism for promoting EGFR TKI resistance in GBM and our finding\r\nof the involvement of FGFR-mediated PTEN tyrosine 240 phosphorylation, it is clear that single targeted\r\nagents will not suffice as a curative approach for treating this disease. The studies in this proposal are\r\ndesigned to understand how FGFR is able to negate PTEN function through the identified phosphorylation\r\nevent and with this knowledge, test for the restoration of EGFR TKI sensitivity by blocking FGFR activity or\r\nassociated mechanisms that lead to PTEN tyrosine 240 phosphorylation. It is hoped that information gained\r\nhere can be applied to patients in the long run for more effective treatment, and even cure, of this universally\r\nfatal brain cancer.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020319\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '446,844', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

At least another third of patients can only be cured at high cost, namely severe neurological, mental, psychosocial, endocrine, cardiac, and renal deficits. In the past, diagnosis was solely derived from histopathological assessment of the tumor tissue. Recent evidence from genome-wide screening projects (including DNA copy-number analysis, gene expression profiling, and DNA-methylation analyses) clearly suggests that medulloblastoma is in fact a group of molecularly, epidemiologically, and prognostically distinct diseases comprising at least four major variants. Across all of these molecular variants, patients with microscopic or macroscopic dissemination of their tumor (throughout the CNS, occasionally even throughout the body) have a much worse probability of being cured. One major reason why brain tumors as a group have replaced leukemias as the leading cause of cancer death in children, despite the latter being much more common, is that our knowledge of the genetic repertoire of leukemias is much more comprehensive. These scientific insights have been successfully exploited for molecular diagnostics, treatment monitoring, tailoring treatment intensity to disease risk, and molecular targeted therapies in selected cases for more than a decade. This body of knowledge is only now starting to grow for medulloblastoma, the deadliest brain tumor in children. A challenging decision on whether to regard patients as clinically high risk is the definition of “microscopic metastases”. To justify this diagnosis, “united cell structures” of malignant cells have to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients at the time of primary diagnosis, according to a widely used classification system proposed by Chang and colleagues in the late 1960s. It is anticipated, however, that almost all patients have some kind of CSF dissemination, and that medulloblastoma is in fact a disease that involves the entire CNS rather than only the cerebellum, where the primary tumor occurs. This may be illustrated by the fact that many patients who are considered non-metastatic at the time of diagnosis will subsequently develop a relapse at a distant site, e.g., the spine. Patients with recurrent disease typically have a fatal prognosis, and most will die within one year after tumor recurrence was diagnosed. As a result of this, a refined detection of CSF dissemination is urgently warranted. One very promising avenue to achieve this is by tracking and quantifying tumor-specific genetic aberrations in this fluid. Identifying tumor-specific mutations in DNA from the CSF could not only be used for the diagnosis of CSF dissemination, but also for molecular subgrouping, treatment monitoring (i.e., clearance of the CSF in the course of treatment), and surveillance of patients after completing treatment (i.e., detection of early microscopic relapse). The latter two aspects are again in analogy to a very successful concept that has been applied in leukemia patients for many years, namely “minimal residual disease monitoring”. In leukemia patients, this is achieved by detecting characteristic genetic aberrations of the leukemia cell clone in the bone marrow, down to a level of 1 tumor cell in 100,000 normal cells. This information is used all over the world to stratify patients into therapy groups with different treatment intensity, to monitor treatment response, and for early detection of leukemia recurrence. If it was possible to use CSF genetics for the same purpose in brain tumor patients, this would revolutionize current clinical practice. Our proposed approach to test the feasibility of using CSF genetics in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of medulloblastoma patients involves three important steps. In a first phase, we will investigate 30 medulloblastoma patients, from whom we have collected frozen tumor samples, CSF at primary diagnosis, and blood (germline control). By sequencing all coding exons in the tumor DNA using next-generation sequencing techniques and comparing these with the germline of the same patient, we will determine the repertoire of somatic (i.e., tumor specific) mutations in these 30 tumor samples. In a second step, we will quantify the abundance of tumor-specific mutations in the CSF of the respective patient down to a resolution of 1 copy of the mutant allele in 50 copies of the wildtype (germline) allele. Finally, in the third phase of the project we will be able to compare serial CSF samples from ten patients over the course of their disease to assess whether it is possible to quantify molecular CSF clearance after treatment. In the first five months of funding for this project, we have made significant progress in optimizing DNA extraction, quantification and amplification procedures, and in demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach. Due to the decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing, we were in fact able to apply high-coverage next generation sequencing techniques to the CSF DNA in addition to the primary tumor and control. As such, the preliminary results were actually better than anticipated, and this has enabled us to significantly expand the scope of the proposal, by using whole-exome deep-sequencing of the CSF DNA, within the same budgetary requirements (as outlined in the accompanying documents). On average, we were able to recover ~150ng of DNA from 1ml of CSF (range 80-950ng). To maximize the number of samples available, we used whole genome amplification (WGA) to boost the DNA quantity. This technique, however, is known to introduce a number of artifacts in the resulting DNA. To overcome this, we developed a novel multiplexing protocol to sequence independent amplifications from the same CSF DNA sample. We were thereby able to reduce the number of mutation calls from ~1000 per sample to only 10 high-confidence hits, exactly in line with the observed mutation rate when sequencing primary tumors. Some of these mutations were seen in a high fraction of the CSF DNA, despite being detected in only a minor fraction of the sequence data from the primary tumor. This may indicate that the cells being shed into the CSF derive from a distinct subclone of the main tumor bulk, in keeping with a recent report to which our group contributed. Further investigation of this phenomenon is now also a goal of the current proposal. In summary, we strongly believe that genetic testing of the CSF of medulloblastoma patients has the potential to significantly influence clinical decision making in terms of diagnosis, assessment of therapy response, selection of therapeutic agents, and patient surveillance. Therefore, we think our proposal exactly serves the major goals of the JSM foundation call on brain cancer research, namely the generation of novel insights leading to increased cure rates and improved functional outcome for brain tumor patients in a truly translational sense.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'German Cancer Research Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2012', 'amount': '441,462', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

At a cellular scale, the number of unicellular organisms whose genome has been completely sequenced has grown exponentially in the last few years. For each of these organisms, we know with remarkable accuracy the exact sequence of nucleotides in their DNA-in other words, we know their bio- chemical \"blueprint.\" Unfortunately, our understanding of cellular processes has not grown proportionally. For example, experimental evidence demonstrates that only 20% of the genes in yeast are essential for survival, but the reasons why these genes are essential while others are not are not generally known. Similarly, at the scale of global socio-economic systems, despite a fast increase in computational capabilities to process global-scale information, our predictive power has not increased at the same pace. For example, nowadays it is possible to track financial and commercial relationships between companies, but when a global crisis develops little is known about what will be the ultimate consequences or about which countries will be most affected. One of the reasons behind the disparity between the amount information available to us and our understanding of these problems is that in complex systems, such as cells and economies, individual components interact with each other through complex networks of interactions that are neither totally regular nor totally random. The reason why real-world networks are non- trivial is that any bias, however small, in the way components establish connections gives rise to structural correlations. This makes understanding complex systems challenging but, at the same time, it means that each network contains, hidden within its structure, important cues about how the system operates and evolves. The goal of our research is to develop a theoretical framework and computational tools that will help us, for example, understand a certain cellular function from limited knowledge about the interactions between the proteins involved; or uncover novel gene-disease associations from the relatively few associations we already know; or determine which interactions in an economy are the most critical to avoid systemic crisis. Although in the last ten years significant progress has been made in the study of networks, we are still far from the ultimate goals of: (i) fully characterizing real-world complex networks; (ii) understanding the precise mechanisms responsible for the observed topologies; and (iii) evaluating the impact of the structure of the network on the dynamics of the system. Consider the case of the human proteome-the network formed by all proteins expressed in human cells and all the interactions between these proteins. The proteome holds the promise of uncovering the fundamental processes occurring within normal and diseased cells. Ultimately, there is reason to trust that fully characterizing the proteome will enable us to design better diagnostic tools, to identify more suitable drug targets (more effective and with less side effects), and to design better therapies-in short, to significantly improve our quality of life. These prospects may justify the billion-dollar estimated cost of the human proteome project. The human proteome project, however, also provides an illustration of the challenges ahead of us. Proteome-charting relies on high-throughput techniques whose accuracies were estimated in 2002 to be below 20%. Even after spending millions of dollars and using such \"quick-and- dirty\" methods, current estimates suggest that a dismal 0.3% of all the physical protein-protein interactions in human proteome have been uncovered so far. The is, therefore, to obtain of this network. To grasp the magnitude of the , imagine that we somehow manage to obtain the remaining 99.7% of the human proteome in the near future-we are then left with about 25,000 proteins and 650,000 interactions between them. How are we supposed to identify drug targets from such a ? Which are the basic organizational principles of the network? Which are the key players (proteins and interactions)? Where do we even start looking? These two challenges (data reliability and information overload) are not specific to the human proteome or even to networks in systems biology. Consider the problem of charting how species interact in ecosystems and how this impacts the propagation of contaminants and other types of ecological perturbations; or, how people commute and travel every day and the impact this has on the spread of epidemics; or the role of the network of inter-organization financial relationships and its role in the making and propagation of a global economic crisis. As daunting as the challenges may seem, we are now closer to their solution thanks to a decade of network research, and especially to recent progress in understanding the group structure of complex networks. Indeed, individual components of complex systems can be classified into groups, and group membership determines the pattern of interactions of each component. As an illustrative example, consider the air transportation network, in which nodes represent cities and connections represent direct flights between cities-two cities in the same continent are more likely to be connected to one other than two cities in different continents. An important consideration is that, in general, there are multiple relevant groupings of the components of the system. For example, in the air transportation network cities can also be grouped according to their role, so that international hubs like Paris or New York are likely to be connected to each other, regardless of whether they are in different continents. The \"geographic\" and the \"role\" descriptions of the air transportation network convey different connection mechanisms that reflect the historical and economic pressures that have shaped the network: the network we observe is the result of the superposition of these two mechanisms (and probably others). Unlike for the air transportation network, we do not usually know a priori which are the relevant groupings of the components of a system (say, proteins in the human proteome). Importantly, we have recently shown that using statistical inference one can identify and sample among groupings with significant explanatory power. This approach opens the door to tackle the two network challenges described above. First, by identifying the most relevant groupings we can point out connections that deviate from the leading group-to-group patterns, which may correspond to observation errors or to connections with special functional requirements (and with special dynamical roles). Second, we can use the most relevant groupings to make educated guesses as to what connections are missing from our reconstructions and, ultimately, to reconstruct whole networks from partial and sparse observations. Finally, the most relevant groupings provide optimal coarse-grained descriptors of the networks, thus helping us solve the \"information overload\" challenge. After a decade of network research, the time has come to provide answers that will usher in real breakthroughs in our understanding of complex systems. These breakthroughs will not come from a single approach; ours builds upon some of the knowledge accumulated during these years, and holds the promise to provide a connection between topology and dynamics using a single comprehensive framework.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Universitat Rovira i Virgili-ICREA', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020228\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '445,663', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Such uniqueness has seemingly been necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, the research program pursued in my lab offers a new perspective on the cerebral bases of our cognitive advantage over other animals, despite the \"modest\" absolute size of our brain. We aim to examine our novel proposition that, when numbers of brain neurons are examined directly, humans are, after all, not outliers in what regards brain size, brain development and maturation, relative cortical size, and even brain metabolism. Rather, the key feature that sets us apart from other animals might be sheer number of brain neurons, achieved by a combination of developmental and evolutionary mechanisms that, without being unique to humans, leads to our cognitive advantage over other animals. Our main research goal in the Laboratory of Comparative Neuroanatomy at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is to unveil the origins of brain diversity in evolution and development and, through a comparative approach, to understand how the cellular composition of the human brain might make us human.

Through these studies, executed in parallel in humans and other species, we aim to establish how the human brain compares to others, smaller and larger than ours, in its cellular composition, cortical folding, prefrontal grey and white matter expansion, cortico-cerebellar expansion and connectivity, synaptic density and metabolism; and how its cellular composition impacts on our cognitive abilities making them second to none.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020232\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The brain is also efficient; it runs at only 25 watts. Furthermore, along with the many less quantifiable glories of human thought, the brain is able to perform quite perplexing feats of recall and recognition. It is not known how all this is achieved, but it is clear that neuronal signalling, in the form of spike trains, is at the heart of this mystery. Our mental abilities, our ability to reliably perceive external stimuli, together with all those other mental processes which contribute to the diverse qualia that constitute our thinking selves, rely on information being communicated as spike trains. Questions about neuronal signalling that are well understood intuitively are not easily phrased in a meaningful and addressable form. This is a mathematical problem: there is no good mathematical description of spike trains. Spike trains need to be described in a way that is mathematically natural and informed by the biology of data processing in neuronal networks. I have a background in mathematical physics. I had an established research programme on integrable solitons in three dimensions particle physics, a subject which combines topology, geometry and computation. A few years ago, numerical calculations involving simulated annealing lead me to an interest in complexity and, ultimately, to the realization that there is hugely exciting new mathematics to be discovered in neuroscience. My background informs the work of my laboratory: often experimental results are shoehorned into an established, but inappropriate, mathematical framework. We believe our strength in mathematics give us the confidence and ability to discover the appropriate mathematics for the problem. The unifying theme of our research is the idea that the important features of spike trains, their information content and temporal structure, will be easy to calculate and study when a natural mathematical framework has been constructed. We have discovered a new metric, based on the biology of synaptic transmission. This metric seems to be useful for describing sparseness in neuronal firing rates.

A vehicle traveling at the speed limit is forced to brake every half mile for a traffic light. A car arriving at a crossroad seconds earlier triggers a traffic signal stopping a large group of vehicles traveling on the main road. Commuters face such frustrations each day. Urban traffic is controlled by traffic lights which have inherent inefficiencies that cause needless delays at traffic intersections. Such inefficiencies not only frustrate drivers, but also result in unnecessary engine idling at traffic lights, which has been linked to increased greenhouse gas emissions. In 2007, traffic congestion wasted 2.8 billion gallons of fuel, 4.2 billion hours, and $87.2 billion in delay and fuel costs. The first four-way three-color traffic light was installed in 1920 and since then, research on traffic optimization has brought steady improvements to efficiency. However, we may be at the limit on how far we can go with the current class of optimization techniques; a paradigm shift is necessary for significant additional gains. The traffic system is inherently a complex system - large numbers of intelligent components (i.e., signals, vehicles, sensors and pedestrians) communicate with one another at the local level and exhibit sophisticated, emergent collective behaviors at the global level. Instead of trying to leverage the innate self-organization in such systems, most past \"intelligent\" traffic systems have attempted to use centralized control. Such schemes are not ideal since they typically streamline traffic flow in only one direction and become increasingly inefficient and complex as the number of intersections increases. Our initial work on understanding the behavior of the traffic grid has shown promising results. We examined different conventional and unconventional approaches for signal optimization. Surprisingly, we found that randomly timed signals worked better than using fixed-time signals. More importantly, the rudimentary self-organization algorithm developed was more effective than either random or fixedtiming algorithms. We believe that there is greater potential for improving traffic controls with selforganization. A deeper understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of self-organization in the context of traffic control is required to realize that potential. In the past, available technology might have limited a complex systems approach. However, recent advances in sensors and communications technologies (i.e., increased network connectivity between traffic lights and accuracy in sensors) enable more effective implementation of self-organization within traffic systems, since information can now be shared among traffic lights to coordinate their actions at the local level. The proposed project will set the stage for development of models, simulations, algorithms and rules for self-organization of traffic networks. The goal of this project is to minimize traffic congestion and delays by developing models of traffic signal self-organization, with local decisions made by each traffic signal based on traffic sensor data (e.g., vehicle speed and count). Each signal will only communicate with its immediate neighbors rather than with all the signals in the entire grid. Signals will react to changing conditions without external intervention and automatically recover from unpredictable traffic disturbances, such as disabled vehicles and dangerous weather conditions. Instead of all traffic signals feeding and receiving information from a central controller, each signal analyzes information locally, distributing the computational load and decreasing latency. As each signal shares information with its neighbors, global synchronization occurs over time - with expected effects of reducing vehicle delay, idling, emissions, fuel consumption and driver frustration. We will not only create models for traffic self-organization, but also examine the impact of using current sensor technology to gather information to support the system. We will also estimate the benefits of using data from more recently designed sensors (e.g., vehicular sensors). In nature, many complex systems operate very efficiently through self-organization. Ants, for example, are social insects that self-organize and exhibit sophisticated collective behavior without the directing influence of external control. An ant has limited access to information and its behavioral repertoire is limited to 10-40 elementary behaviors. However, in groups, ants exhibit sophisticated collective behavior and demonstrate a clear division of labor, contributing to the entire colony's success. Some collect food; others take care of eggs, repair the nest, or protect the ant hill against threats. The secret lies in self-organization: Each organism follows simple rules and makes decisions based on local information from its neighbors. Yet collectively, the entire swarm accomplishes complex tasks. The advantage of such a system is its simplicity - where a few basic rules applied locally affect global order resulting in sophisticated behavior. The key to this outcome is finding the proper rules. Analogous to the behavior of social insects, a self-organized traffic system can be designed to optimize flow through the entire traffic grid by using simple rules based on local neighbor information to adjust a single signal's behavior while enabling global synchronization. Complex systems devised by humans differ from those in nature. While natural systems have precise, preordained and predictable global outcomes, most man-made systems exhibit imprecise, unpredictable and chaotic behavior. Precisely controlled communication at the local level leads to desired behavior outcomes at the global level in natural systems. The desire to institute central control in man-made complex systems is inhibitive. A notable exception is the Internet, which uses selforganization by coordinating millions of relatively simple components to collectively create a virtual world exhibiting sophisticated behavior. Internet-based social networking applications - i.e., Facebook, MySpace and LinkedIn - also exhibit such behavior. Stuart Kauffman said: \"If biologists have ignored self-organization, it is not because self-ordering is not pervasive and profound. It is because biologists have yet to understand how to think about systems governed simultaneously by two sources of order. We will have to see that we are the natural expressions of a deeper order.\" In our efforts to control man-made complex systems, we need to embrace their inherent qualities and behaviors in order to align them with their natural states, instead of forcing them under centralized control. Such an understanding of natural systems will help us to resolve some of the difficulties we face in managing complex systems. Associating complex systems with traffic control and developing the proper rules for interaction and behavior can be a difficult undertaking. Rules of self-organization can not only be applied to traffic control, but also for managing other complex systems such as social networks, nanosenor networks for biomedicine, free-market economies and engineering systems. This research will leverage our previous work in engineering optimization3,4 and communication5. Our preliminary work using rudimentary algorithms on a small traffic grid shows promise in applying self-organization techniques to optimize traffic signals. The work proposed will not only investigate how to develop rules for individual traffic signals, but compare different self-organization strategies to manage and organize behavior at a global level. In addition to decreased traffic congestion, we will also explore improved resilience and robustness to failure or unpredictable events. Organisms that self-organize successfully use a limited number of attributes in decision-making. Our goal is also to understand the limits of self-organization. As the number of attributes increase, will self-organization still be feasible? For instance, the free-market economy is a self-organizing system with a basic set of rules that all participants must follow. It generally works efficiently; however, its rules occasionally need to be tweaked as participants capitalize on its inefficiencies and disrupt its natural harmony. Such possible flaws in the rules of self-organization for traffic control can lead to dangerous traffic conditions and need to be identified. Metropolitan areas are engines for economic growth where oftentimes public transportation is available, congestion is moderate, and varied settings exist (i.e. downtown, suburbs and rural areas) in close proximity. These areas offer fertile ground for testing and studying a self-organized traffic system. They will also be able to withstand the minor disruptions associated with deployment and testing of the developed algorithms. Our objective is to study the City of Albany, New York and the surrounding metropolitan area. We are currently working with the Department of Transportation as a testbed for studying this approach. Self-organizing traffic signals promise to revolutionize current traffic-control mechanisms and have the potential for results beyond our expectations. For instance, as they evolve, we might find the need to adapt - we may install speed controllers in cars that will adjust speed based on traffic congestion and signal timing such that it gets a green light when it reaches the intersection. There are broader implications to this work - urban planning may need to be reviewed and traffic rules modified. There is no question that communication and sensors have advanced sufficiently to allow us not only to conceive such a system, but to actually make it a reality. There are several unanswered questions on design of such systems that we will attempt to address in this proposal.

There is astonishing diversity among human cultures, languages, and bodies. Ordinary customs in one culture may appear fantastic to someone across the globe. Sounds that come naturally to speakers of one language may seem alien to speakers of another. Actions that one person performs easily may be impossible for someone with a different kind of body. How is the diversity of the human experience reflected in the mind? What is universal about the concepts we form, and what depends on the particulars of our physical and social experiences? People's experiences vary, so it would seem natural that many of the concepts they form vary, accordingly. Perhaps surprisingly, this has not been the dominant view in the cognitive sciences. From Plato to Chomsky and beyond, influential thinkers have argued that despite superficial variations, most concepts are universal across languages, cultures, and individuals. In testing the universality of concepts, my lab is discovering new frontiers in the of the mind. People with different patterns of physical and social experience form correspondingly different mental representations, across many conceptual domains. This essay describes a research program investigating the mechanisms and the consequences of linguistic relativity, cultural relativity, and what I have called by analogy . So far, we have learned that subtle contrasts between languages and cultures can influence our most basic perceptual and conceptual representations. We find effects of linguistic and cultural relativity even when we probe people's thoughts using low-level psychophysical tasks with non‐linguistic stimuli and responses. Differences between people's bodies predict differences in their neural and mental representations, in domains including language, mental imagery, and emotion. Experimental interventions show that bodily differences are not merely correlated with cognitive differences; bodily experience plays a causal role in shaping the mind. Even our most abstract thoughts depend in part on the particulars of our bodies. Experience molds the mind both in developmental time and in real time, online, as we interact with each other and the world around us. It is an ongoing challenge for this research program to determine why certain streams of experience shape particular mental capacities, and how influences of language, culture, and body combine. From one perspective, effects of experiential relativity demonstrate the diversity of the human conceptual repertoire. But at the same time, they reveal universals in the processes by which knowledge is acquired and represented. If changing someone's linguistic, cultural, or bodily experience changes their thoughts accordingly, we can infer that thinking must depend in part on these aspects of experience. The malleability of the mind that we are discovering has implications for theories of cognition, suggesting refinements to the concept of 'concepts'. The experimental techniques we are developing provide new answers to ancient questions. Explorations of experiential relativity may also have practical implications, beyond the laboratory.

Rupture processes are also of prime technological importance as they limit the strength, stability and durability of many man-made devices, from Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) to bridges and airplanes. Understanding, controlling and predicting the phenomenon of rupture has been a challenge to mankind from the early stages of cultural evolution. In modern times, scientists from diverse disciplines such as engineering, earth science, physics and materials science are continuously striving to develop a coherent and unified picture of rupture. A major stumbling block in achieving this goal is the fact that rupture is an inherently complex phenomenon; the evolution of even a single rupture couples dynamic behavior at length and time scales that are separated by many orders of magnitude, giving rise to a wealth of emergent behaviors. Earthquakes are a striking example of the complexity of rupture phenomena, which involve highly separated interacting scales; immense tectonic forces work for hundreds to thousands of years to slowly load a geological fault separating two tectonic plates, gradually increasing the mechanical energy stored in the fault system. The release of this stored mechanical energy, however, is rapid and occurs at velocities approaching the theoretical speed of information (material sound speed). Most of the released energy is converted into heat that is generated by the frictional forces acting on the fault and opposing the sliding motion, or is used for fragmenting the rock at the fault. Part of it, however, is radiated out by mechanical waves and eventually is converted into the violent ground motion that we generally equate with earthquakes. Earthquakes are thus initiated at geological faults, within a narrow interfacial region that couples two tectonic plates. This narrow interface may be a few millimeters wide, yet hundreds of kilometers long. The fault interface is highly nonuniform at small scales and is composed of a network of discrete load-bearing micro-scale contacts. As only a small fraction of the apparent contact area between the two plates is in real contact, the actual forces acting on this sparse contact network are enormous, reaching the maximal stresses that the material can bear. An earthquake is, essentially, the frictional slip that results from the abrupt release of the mechanical energy stored at the large (tectonic) scales. This huge amount of energy is only released when the ensemble of contacts that had been restraining the motion yields. The subsequent frictional motion of the earth's surface, results from continual contact renewal and fracture that takes place at the fault. This gives rise to extreme and rapidly fluctuating local conditions. The micro-scale physics of the frictional interface, therefore, play a key role in determining the initiation, development and arrest of the rupture fronts that we know as earthquakes; these may be many kilometers long and release, within a few seconds, energy accumulated over centuries. Part of the released energy feeds back into the large scales and may have dramatic consequences such as violent ground motion or Tsunami waves hundreds of kilometers away. Despite decades of intense research, many key aspects of rupture processes are far from understood and a general coherent picture of rupture phenomena is still missing. At the heart of this problem are two basic issues in 'complexity science'. The first concerns the multi-scale nature of rupture phenomena. How can one integrate the striking multi-scale nature of the physics of rupture into a single coherent theoretical framework? The second is the question of predictability; although rupture is inherently a coherent phenomenon it is unclear if its size or timing may be predicted. The coupling between vastly separated time and length scales that drives an earthquake is characteristic of the seemingly diverse rupture phenomena observed in numerous geological, physical and biological systems. To illustrate these basic similarities, consider a gecko climbing a wall. Although this biological phenomenon may appear completely different from earthquake dynamics, some striking similarities exist. The contact between the gecko's foot and the wall is highly nonuniform and spans a wide range of scales. The foot is macroscopic in size and exhibits an incredible hierarchal structure; it is composed of 5 toes, each toe is composed of about 20 rows of sticky setal arrays, with each setal array consisting of thousands of micrometer-scale setal stalks amounting to approximately 200,000 setae per toe with each seta terminating with 100-1000 sub-micrometer-scale spatulae. Therefore, the frictional forces that adhere the gecko's feet to the wall are generated by the frictional strength of a huge ensemble of discrete sub-micro-scale contacts, as in the network of micro-scale contacts that hold a geological fault together prior to an earthquake. To climb, the gecko must initiate rapid rupture of the interface between its foot and the wall, a process in which the sub-micron scale contacts collectively detach at time scales significantly shorter than those of the global motion. Thus both gecko motion and earthquake dynamics exhibit a similar hierarchy of complex, multi-scale rupture processes. Surprisingly, our current knowledge of earthquake dynamics is much less detailed than our understanding of a gecko's walk. The major stumbling block is that earthquakes are nucleated far below the earth's surface, at seismogenic depths that often exceed 10km. Our major source of information of how these complex processes unfold is due to seismology, where approximate reconstructions of the rupture dynamics are obtained from the sound waves emitted by the rupture and recorded at seismic stations located far from the rupture source. As direct observations of interfacial fault processes are nearly impossible, our understanding of the basic physics involved remains limited. Developing a predictive theoretical framework for rupture phenomena entails the development of novel experimental, mathematical and conceptual tools to bridge over the numerous distinct scales. Here we propose a two-pronged investigation of rupture dynamics along a rough quasi-one-dimensional interface that models fault dynamics. We intend to gain new insights into the physics of rupture by embarking on this interdisciplinary research program, which couples multi-scale mathematical modeling with innovative laboratory experiments. A major obstacle to fundamental understanding of rupture processes is a lack of detailed information about the space-time evolution of the contact area and stresses along the interface. We will overcome this by coupling direct real-time visualization of the real area of contact to precise local measurements of stresses, slip displacement and slip velocities at points adjacent to the interface. Such a comprehensive approach to rupture evolution, in which all of the relevant local quantities that characterize a frictional interface are simultaneously measured, has never been previously attempted. The experiments will provide a detailed record of the rupture process at an unprecedented range (from microseconds to minutes) of temporal and spatial scales. Preliminary results already indicate a crucial coupling between scales, where coherent elastic energy at very large wavelengths couples to dissipative processes which take place at the microscopic scale within the frictional interface. These interfacial processes will be modeled by a novel multi-scale approach that is capable of investigating the interactions between the large elastic scales that characterize the energy stored within the system with the small-scale and rapid dissipative processes that occur within the interface and release this stored energy. This approach will be flexible enough to incorporate a wide range of small-scale physical processes, allowing us to investigate the intricate interactions between different time and length scales involved in the rupture process. Once the nature of the small-scale and rapid frictional processes is unraveled, our next step will develop a continuum level description of the interfacial small-scale physics. Integrating this continuum description with analytical and numerical calculations will enable us to both systematically explore rupture phenomena at a macroscopic level, and to test the predictions of the emerging picture against experimental observations. Finally, we plan to explore the links between our results and available geological and geophysical insights and observations. Together, we hope to develop a physics-based picture of rupture along an interface in general and earthquake nucleation and evolution in particular. The time is right for this multidisciplinary study as both laboratory and modeling capabilities have recently advanced to a stage that makes the aims of the proposed research both feasible and timely.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The Hebrew University of Jerusalem', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020221\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

I study the computational basis of mental representations that underly higher-level cognition by using a combination of formal modeling and behavioral experimentation. The ultimate goal of my work is to develop a formal theory of the structure of thought that accounts for the systematic and flexible inferences central to human cognition in the real world. To look for broad computational principles, it is useful to consider a broad range of cognitive abilities. My work draws case studies from causal reasoning, category learning, and social cognition. Across these areas I aim to understand the primitive elements of mental representation, the ways they combine into complex thoughts and stable representations (concepts), and how these thoughts enable us to respond successfully to the demands of our environment. This is a difficult project, but computational modeling provides formal tools to cut nature at its joints: mathematically precise psychological theories, and frameworks for reasoning out their consequences. My approach integrates probabilistic inference techniques with compositional representations drawn from logic and semantics--together these give systems with the systematic structure of a language and the robust reasoning under uncertainty of statistical induction. These theoretical ideas have crystallized into the probabilistic language of thought hypothesis--a collection of informal principles of mental representation, together with a precise mathematical realization of these principles. If formal modeling is the warp of my work then empirical observation is the weft. I use a variety of experimental techniques to test and refine models. These include: novel behavioral paradigms with adult participants, for instance to study grounded causal learning; collaborations with developmental psychologists to study pre-schoolers and infants; and, increasingly, \"high throughput\" data collection using the internet. In future work I plan to incorporate other methodologies, such as cross-cultural behavioral experiments. In the coming years I will continue theoretical and empirical studies exploring the probabilistic language of thought hypothesis, emphasizing three key themes that have emerged in my recent work. First, that mental representations gain their meaning, and usefulness, partly through their grounding in concrete perception and action. Second, that real-world cognition relies on the interaction between different domains of knowledge--e.g. joint reasoning about causes, objects, and agents. Third, that abstract mental representations arise developmentally from a powerful inductive learning mechanism aided by specialized perceptual supports and cultural input.

The most aggressive subtype of glioma, commonly known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has one of worst prognoses among all types of human tumors. Unfortunately, current treatment options are very limited in their efficacy in combating this deadly tumor type. The goal of our research is to better understand the genetic changes that underlie gliomas and to develop a better model system to study tumor development. Clinically, GBM can be categorized as primary (advanced stage tumors without previous symptoms) or secondary (low-grade tumors that subsequently progress to advanced stages)1. Primary and secondary GBM, although pathologically indistinguishable, exhibit distinct patterns of cancer gene alterations1. Several recent studies, inspired by a major cancer genome sequencing project2, revealed that the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH)1 gene is mutated in more than 70% of secondary GBM or low grade gliomas, but infrequently in primary GBM (about 5%)2-6. The gene mutations appear to be specific for human brain tumors as no gene mutation was found in analyzing over 1000 non-central nervous system tumors. Notably, all of the mutations identified in gliomas are heterozygous and produce a single amino acid substitution at arginine 132, indicating that this particular mutation is distinctly important in the tumor progression of this subtype of glioma. Clinically, GBM patients carrying an mutation had a significantly longer overall survival (31 months) compared to GBM patients with wild-type (15 months). A better understanding of how mutation contributes to this subset of gliomas may someday allow more tailored treatments for these patients. We have recently carried out biochemical, structural and cellular studies of this tumor-derived mutant to understand its mechanism and role in tumor development. Normally, two identical subunits function as a homodimer to convert isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). We found that tumor-derived mutations dominantly inhibit wild-type activity because binding of mutant with wild-type forms inactive heterodimers that are impaired for binding the substrate, isocitrate. Expression of mutant in cultured cells reduces the level of the enzyme product, α-KG. A decrease in α-KG, in turn, increases the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor subunit HIF- 1α, a transcription factor that facilitates tumor growth when oxygen is low. The link between and HIF-1α highlights the importance of altered metabolic regulation to tumorigenesis. In analyzing human tumors, we found that HIF-1α expression was higher in gliomas harboring the mutation than in tumors of similar grade without a mutation. In our cell culture system, the rise in HIF-1α levels was reversible by an α-KG derivative (oct-α-KG). This finding suggests that drugs mimicking α-KG may merit exploration as a therapy for gliomas that harbor an mutation. We conclude from our initial studies that appears to function as a tumor suppressor that, when mutationally inactivated, contributes to tumor progression through induction of the HIF-1 pathway. These results have recently been accepted for publication in the journal of Science. In this application, we propose two lines of research aimed at better understanding the molecular mechanisms and developing mouse model for human low grade gliomas and secondary GBM. In the first aim of our proposed research, we will examine how genetically and molecularly interacts with p53. The cancer genome study identified that mutations frequently occur along with mutations in p53 in the secondary GBM. This suggests that these two genes may collaborate to contribute to tumor development. The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and normally acts as a brake to uncontrolled cell proliferation. We hypothesize that mutation may lead to activation of p53, and that disruption of both - and p53-mediated pathways is required for the development of low-grade gliomas and secondary GBM. Our second aim is to develop a mouse model that accurately recapitulates the genetic and clinical features of low-grade gliomas and secondary GBM. We propose to use genetic engineering approach, known as knock-in, to replace one allele of with the mutant characterized in tumors. Using this mouse model, we will be able to examine how mutant affects glial cell growth and differentiation and the development of tumors. Our hope is that these mice serve as a better model for this particular subclass of glioma, further our understanding of glioma tumor progression and aid in future work to test therapeutic agents for the treatment of glioma patients with mutation in .", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020203\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '449,732', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

We are left with a long list of questions: Why, every year, do we need to update the human influenza vaccine? Why was the recent introduction of West Nile virus to North America associated with increased virulence in birds and humans? And how has the H5N1 ‘bird flu’ virus been able to show an increase in pathogenicity in ducks over just a few years? Pathogen evolution is happening on a short time-scale, with global consequences for human and animal health. Pathogens demonstrate this rapid evolution due to a combination of high mutation rates (e.g. imperfect replication of RNA viruses causes mutations to occur very frequently), short generation times (relative to host lifespan) and strong selection pressure (there is a high cost to failing to infect, and multiple ways in which failure can occur). The first two of these processes are responsible for generating multi-strain pathogen populations and the third process regulates that population. Dealing with multi-strain pathogens is, naturally, more complicated than a single-strain organism. However, research efforts have made great progress in embracing the complexity and describing the dynamics of multi-strain pathogens. Explaining how these pathogen populations will evolve over time, however, has remained a difficult intellectual challenge. Although such evolution may seem unpredictable, it occurs in a complex system of interacting ecological, population, epidemiological and evolutionary processes. When viewed as a set of component mechanisms acting to change the composition of pathogen and host communities, we can begin to understand how evolutionary forces will act. Host populations are hierarchical and may even be composed of multiple species. Within a species, the population size and the composition of the population are important drivers of host-pathogen interactions. As well as natural selection and mutation, by including consideration of host populations as resources (of variable size and quality) for pathogens, we gain insight into the factors that shape pathogen communities. Most of the theoretical research in evolutionary epidemiology has focused on understanding the long-term trends of pathogen populations. These models deal exclusively with situations in which a pathogen has established a stable endemic equilibrium in a host population and then consider whether a novel strain arising through mutation is able to displace the resident strain. Whilst these techniques remain valuable guiding tools, we now have the opportunity to develop these ideas to consider more realistic, complex scenarios in which the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics occur on a similar time-scale and interact with each other. Mathematical and computational methods provide a quantitative framework for expressing the change in frequencies of pathogen strains in terms of fitness; relating fitness to specific pathogen traits; and decomposing ‘evolution’ into component forces (specifically natural selection, mutation and environmental change) Using these techniques we can understand the dominant processes at play in shaping the evolutionary dynamics of pathogens and begin to make predictions about how they will evolve in a variety of real-world settings. Against the backdrop of emerging pathogens and their demonstrable ability to evolve to more ‘problematic’ forms, this is clearly the time to take up the challenge. This project will bridge the gap between traditional theoretical methods for considering pathogen evolution and the emerging data on rapid disease evolution. It will begin by developing a conceptual framework to predict the trait dynamics of multi-strain pathogen populations in realistic situations. Pathogen traits include transmissibility, infectious period and virulence. The keystone of this framework is the partitioning of forces that change mean pathogen fitness into the components of natural selection, mutation, and environmental effects and establishing the relationship between fitness and trait values. Further, it complements traditional epidemiological approaches, which are centered on the per generation measure of pathogen fitness (the basic reproductive number, R0) by instead measuring pathogen fitness per unit time, which enables a joint examination of epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics. Following the development of this framework, I will consider the application of this method to four central problems in evolutionary epidemiology: As the project answers this ensemble of linked research questions, it will advance the nascent field of evolutionary epidemiology whilst at the same time providing tools that contribute to the global challenge of controlling infectious diseases. Among the benefits of this project will be the development of techniques to address a broad range of infectious diseases. However, it is motivated by real epidemiological issues and diseases. Indeed, unique equine influenza data have helped shape the project, as, for the first time, they allow us to relate antigenic changes in influenza strains to the: The techniques that will be developed are extensible to a range of complex systems in which there is (co)evolution, fitness-determining environmental fluctuations, and species interactions. These include the fields of biological invasions, predator-prey systems, food-webs and community ecology. Here, I focus on a pathogen’s host resource as the key environmental dynamic, but the methods would apply equally well to other biotic organisms or abiotic factors such as climate, opening up a wide range of topics for future study. Components of this project will also contribute to the general problem of dealing with uncertainty in complex biological systems. As mathematical and computational techniques continue to offer insight into the natural world it is important to also consider how they can best be used against a backdrop of environmental and population-level variation, as well as incomplete and imperfect information that we are able to collect by sampling natural systems.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Georgia', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020193\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '448,249', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Glioblastomas are the most common primary brain tumors and recent reports have shown that glioblastoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases that can be subclassified by shared genetic aberrations. The implication is that, in part, the underlying genetics may determine the responsiveness to treatments and thus allow us to personalize therapy. Several years ago, we noted a glioblastoma patient with dramatic responsiveness to imatinib mesylate, a platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) kinase inhibitor. We investigated this case and found a molecular biomarker. We subsequently investigated clinical trial patients on a negative phase I/II trial of imatinib in recurrent malignant gliomas and found this same biomarker in some of the responders. Since then we have been evaluating these cases for mutations and other genetic abnormalities. These results illustrate the potential responsiveness of a molecularly defined subset of glioblastomas and the poor results of prior trials might in fact be due to not enriching for responsive patients. Linking such individual treatment responsiveness to the detailed genetics of tumor will be the crucial next step to truly personalizing cancer therapies. The above data has provided the rationale to initiate a prospective trial of PDGFR inhibitors in biomarker-enriched high-grade glioma patients. With the JSMF grant, we hope to validate that PDGFR aberrations predict response to PDGFR kinase inhibitor and identify in further detail mechanisms of response and resistance. This will allow us to then plan future studies of combination trials to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve efficacy of targeted therapies. In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize genomic aberrations of PDGFR and related genes in human glioma tissues from PDGFR kinase inhibitor based clinical trials. We will use fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for qualitative assessment (high focal amplification vs. polysomy vs. non-amplified) and QPCR for quantitative assessment of copy number. Using FISH we analyzed our dataset and found a significant association (trend test; p < 0.001). We are currently obtaining tissue from several clinical trials from European consortium (EORTC Brain Tumor Group) and other sites to independently validate our findings. We have also developed a QPCR based assay to detect copy number of relevant genes (e.g. MET, EGFR, etc.) that has improved our sensitivity and screening efficiency from paraffin tissues. The samples will also be analyzed for mutations using the WAVE HS system (Transgenomic, Inc) followed by sequencing to confirm mutations. We will also use genome wide approaches (Agilent array CGH, Affymetrix gene expression profiling, high throughput sequencing, etc) where feasible to characterize the tissue samples further. We will also analyze tissues from recently initiated biomarker-enriched prospective clinical trials of PDGFR inhibitors in glioblastomas. In Aim 2, we will correlate genetics of PDRFR and other related genes to patient response (imaging response and progression free survival) to PDGFR kinase inhibitors in retrospective and prospective clinical trials. Patients’ imaging response was defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) by MacDonald criteria and overall and progression free survival by standard neuro-oncology criteria. We will correlate the genetic findings in Aim 1 with response to PDGFR kinase inhibitors from several retrospective studies and prospective studies to validate our hypothesis that aberrations in PDGFR a predict response to PDGFR kinase inhibitors. These will be analyzed individually and pooled to increase power. Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimates and logrank tests of imaging response, overall and progression-free survival curves stratified by PDGFR and other relevant genes, Cox proportional hazards models of times to death and progression testing for association with molecular status with adjustment for age, KPS, and other relevant baseline predictors. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the genomic aberrations found in Aims 1 and 2 using human and mouse glioma stem cell models. We will validate the molecular basis for responsiveness to PDGFR kinase inhibitors in these systems and as means to discover mechanisms of resistance. We have been collecting and growing a library of fresh human glioma stem cell lines (“living tissue bank”) from our patients grown as neurospheres and propagated in mice. These lines are highly annotated and monitored over time for maintenance of key glioblastoma characteristics using genome-wide technologies. Several of these lines have PDGFR aberrations and have constitutively activated PDGFRA. We also have normal and tumorigenic murine stem cells (Ink4a/ARF-/- with expression of either EGFRvIII, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, BRAF, etc) using retroviral expression constructs. We will use both the human and mouse lines to correlate genetics with response to PDGFR kinase inhibitors and identify molecular mechanisms of resistance. Such data will generate new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to PDGFR kinase inhibitors that can then be validated prospectively in ongoing and future human trials. This will also allow us to then plan future studies of combination trials to overcome resistance mechanisms or improve efficacy of PDGFR kinase directed therapies. This proposal seeks to fulfill the intent of the JSMF Foundation on many levels. The work proposed is novel and unsupported by any outside funding mechanism at this point. The proposal involves validating a genetic biomarker of response to PDGFR kinase inhibitors in retrospective and prospective clinical trials of glioblastoma and elucidating the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance. Linking such individual patient tumor genotypes to treatment responsiveness will be the crucial next step to truly personalizing brain tumor therapies and is the focus of my future translational research efforts. This proposal represents a highly collaborative effort between clinicians and scientists in neuro-oncology, neurosurgery, cancer biology, medical oncology, neuroradiology and pathology.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - San Diego', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020202\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '424,476', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

One of the unique and defining characteristics of living creatures is the ability to transport material and information in a directed, regulated and timely fashion. Consider the basic unit of almost all forms of life - the cell. If the cell were a completely closed system with an impenetrable membrane, it would eventually reach equilibrium and die. The very existence of a functioning cell constitutes a never-ending fight against entropy. The cell therefore, has to exchange material and information with the exterior world. In addition, it has to keep all its various organelles with different functions intact and separate and facilitate the transmission of information and materials between these organelles in a well-regulated and timely fashion. In many ways, the interior of a eukaryotic cell is like a teeming metropolis. The nucleus, which is the repository of genetic information, mirrors the city hall, being a seat of legislative power while also doubling as the public library. The mitochondrion, which generates most of the cell’s supply of fuel (ATP) is the power-station of the city, while the Golgi apparatus that is responsible for packaging and processing proteins and lipids functions as the post-office. The endoplasmic reticulum functions as a factory manufacturing proteins upon demand, while the lysosome, which is involved with the digestion of waste, performs the same function as a recycling center. Just as in a city, there needs to be a constant flow of information and material between these vital units. In a city, we have well developed networks of highways and roads with trucking and postal units that take care of transportation along these networks. In the cell, the highways and roads are provided by an interconnected network of filamentous proteins such as actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments that make up the cell’s cytoskeleton. Molecular size motors such as myosin and kinesin are able to walk along these filaments powered by fuel in the form of ATP. These motors have the ability to drag cargo vesicles, which are filled with different kinds of macromolecules and carry molecules encoding destination addresses on their surfaces. The motors then perform the function of delivery trucks: transporting the cargo vesicles to different destinations, which either choose to accept them or not, depending on the attached address. Specific examples of vesicle trafficking include transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, transport between the Golgi stacks and the trans-Golgi network and the export of newly synthesized proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomes and cell membrane. In a city, the failure of the trafficking system and the disruption of lines of communication can lead to paralysis and chaos. Similarly, at the cellular level, the disruption of any of the steps involved in transport can lead to scores of diseases ranging from cystic fibrosis to Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the nature of intracellular transport processes is thus of crucial importance. A great deal has been learnt, by studying individual motors moving along single tracks in carefully controlled conditions. It is enticing to combine this molecular level knowledge with the general analogy of transport in a city and conclude that we have a reasonably good understanding of intracellular transport. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The reason is that our analogy simply cannot be scaled down to the cellular level. At the length scales of the motors in the cell, a staggering coincidence occurs, with forces of thermal, chemical, mechanical and electrostatic origin all having roughly the same order of magnitude. The motors therefore operate in a chaotic and hostile environment where the forces they can exert are comparable to the stickiness with the tracks and the forces exerted by other molecules colliding with them. In addition, as we shall show, the cytoskeletal network is not an ordered array of tracks, but actually has a fractal geometry. Furthermore, the filaments that make up the network can be in a continual state of turn-over- shrinking, growing and getting chopped up- all of these processes being controlled by dozens of regulatory proteins. Scaled back up to human dimensions, this would mean that the cargo trucks travel on an ever-changing fractal network of muddy roads while being bombarded by a rain of boulders. Given these conditions it is almost a miracle that the cargo can actually get to its destination and hence keep us alive. Thus, our deterministic notions of transport based on trucks on highways simply fails at the cellular level. What is needed is then a completely different view- a statistical description of transport along fractal and dynamic networks. Fortunately, there have been decades of research on diffusion and transport in fractal networks in the Physics community. This kind of approach has been essential in describing the transport of fluids through porous media, the transport of macromolecules through polymer gels and the transport of electrons in disordered media among various other applications. Our goal is to bring this statistical mechanical understanding of transport in disordered and fractal media from the Physics community and apply it to the problem of intracellular transport. There are several aspects of this problem that pose exciting challenges. Firstly, there has been no characterization of the actual geometry of the underlying cytoskeletal network from a transport perspective, even treating it as static. We will characterize the geometry using a variety of fractal exponents such as the fractal dimension, topological dimension and random walk dimension among others. Knowing these exponents will allow us to make very concrete statements about the transport behavior in these systems. In particular, I am interested in the range of these exponents in vivo and whether there exists transitions between regimes with different exponents that could be triggered by changing regulatory protein concentrations. Diffusion is known to be anomalous on fractal substrates and it would be exciting to see the character of diffusion on these cytoskeletal networks. Secondly, as mentioned above, the network is not static but highly dynamic. We will look explicitly at the time required to move between specific points in the network, how it is influenced by the dynamics of the network, the range of behaviors we can expect in vivo and again whether there exist dynamical transitions between qualitatively different transport regimes that can be triggered by regulatory proteins. From a fundamental complex systems perspective, these systems exhibit an interplay between stochastic motion, structural complexity of the environment and its dynamics, not typically present in traditional physical systems, leading to novel transport phenomena. Insights into these systems can be applied to the general problem of transport on complex time-dependent networks that could have implications for such systems as information transfer and routing on dynamic computer networks and the spreading of populations and diseases on large-scale time-evolving ecological and human networks.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Merced', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020194\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '301,702', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This research programme aims to understand both\r\ncognitive and emotional aspects of mathematical development in primary school where\r\nimportant building blocks of human specific mathematical knowledge are put in place.\r\nTaking an Educational Neuroscience approach we study how the full range of educational\r\nachievements relate to cognitive and emotional factors in children with mathematical learning\r\nproblems, typically achieving children and gifted children. Improved knowledge will enable\r\nus to prevent and/or remediate cognitive and emotional mathematical learning problems. This\r\nwill ultimately improve the level of mathematical competence in the whole of the population. About 6% of children have developmental dyscalculia which is a specific learning\r\ndifficulty of mathematics. Children with developmental dyscalculia have normal intelligence\r\nand their reading skills may be perfect. We aim to determine whether developmental\r\ndyscalculia and relatively weak or particularly strong mathematical ability can be related to\r\nindividual variability in exactly specified components of memory function and executive\r\nattention. We also study how these cognitive factors relate to logical reasoning ability.\r\nDevelopmental dyscalculia can only be understood in the context of normal development\r\nbecause both children and the mathematical curriculum are constantly changing during\r\nschooling. Hence, we pay special attention to mapping how normal mathematical competence\r\ndevelops during each year of primary school and how the particularly weak and strong\r\nperformers differ from typical achievers. The study of gifted children may enable us to\r\nunderstand how typical and weak performers can achieve similarly strong performance. Besides cognitive difficulties a substantial number of children and adults have\r\nmathematics anxiety, a debilitating emotional reaction to mathematics. Mathematics anxiety\r\nis clearly distinguishable from general anxiety and it ranges from a feeling of mild tension to\r\nexperiencing a strong fear of mathematics. Mathematics anxiety may generalize to various\r\nsituations with the consequence that otherwise perfectly intelligent and capable persons\r\ndevelop a severe avoidance of situations involving any kinds of mathematics and do not\r\nchoose careers involving the application of mathematics. One line of our research examines\r\nwhat triggers mathematics anxiety in children. Further, we investigate developmental\r\ndyscalculia and mathematics anxiety in a joint framework because emotional and cognitive\r\nprocesses are likely intertwined.

We lack theory and \r\nmodels that can be used to address the population dynamics and movements of animals that migrate seasonally. This is surprising because the spectacular phenomenon of migration has fascinated people for centuries and because migratory species, which are found within a wide range of taxa including birds, marine mammals, ungulates, and insects, comprise a large proportion of the earth’s \r\nbiodiversity. Many migratory species, especially those that migrate long \r\ndistances whether by land, air, or sea, are facing considerable threats \r\nfrom anthropogenic habitat loss and degradation, and from changes to the environment wrought by climate change. There is, therefore a pressing need to develop models and theory that can be used to understand the complex dynamics of migratory populations.  I propose that the ecology of migratory species can be studied by developing a new theoretical framework, . Migratory networks consist of nodes representing habitat regions connected by the regular, seasonal movements of species. Migratory networks differ from other ecological networks in that nodes can be different functional habitat types (breeding and non-­‐breeding) and that each node is only occupied seasonally. As well as being important visualization tools, Migratory Networks are complex, nonlinear models that predict occupancy of nodes and strength of connections. These models will show how changes in phenology and alterations to quality and quantity of habitat patches along the migration route alter the connectivity of the network, the timing of migratory movements and population dynamics.  An important aspect of this research plan is the synergistic development of Migratory Network theory with its application to real-¬world species. I am currently working with collaborators to apply migratory network models to Tree Swallows, Wood Thrush, and Monarch Butterflies.  Migratory networks will be used to explore the effects of climate change, habitat loss, and infectious disease on the movements and population dynamics of migratory species. Migratory networks will also be used to examine theoretical hypotheses to explain patterns of migration, evolution of migration, and general effects of climate change. The application to real-­‐world migratory systems is intrinsically linked\r\nto the development of the theory itself as well as to the development of tools that will make the theory useful for conservation and policy.

Complex systems consist of a large number of components interacting\r\nin such a way that the group as a whole may produce nonlinear unexpected responses often\r\nexhibiting phase transitions, cascades, crises, catastrophes, and other critical and extreme events. The nature, intensity and coupling of interactions among the different components encode these\r\nemerging intriguing features. Mapping complexity by tracing and appraising these interactions is\r\nnow possible for many real systems thanks to the amount of empirical data available and the current\r\nexplosion in computing power. Through history, maps have been at the center of political,\r\neconomic and geostrategic decisions to become a critical piece in our every day lives, serving as\r\nan integral, accurate, and relevant information source. Their appeal is not only visual, they provide\r\na way of storing and presenting information and communicating findings, they let us recognize locational\r\ndistributions and spatial relationships and make it possible for us to conceptualize patterns\r\nand processes that operate through space. Our goal is to map complexity, to map complex real systems\r\nin an embedding metric space that ought not to be geographical or spatially obvious but that\r\nmay be a condensate of different intrinsic attributes determining how distant, or conversely similar,\r\nthe elements of the system are. For discrete complex systems, such maps are based on topological objects called complex\r\nnetworks, graphs where elements are represented as nodes and their interactions as links, and on\r\ncoarse-grained network representations that highlight their modular structure. All real networks\r\nare imprinted with universal features regardless of their origin. One of the most paradigmatic\r\nexamples is the small-world phenomenon, making every pair of nodes in a network to be connected\r\nin a short topological distance on average. As a consequence, small-world networks present an\r\napparent lack of metric structure defined on the system. Certainly, in a small-world network any\r\npair of nodes is roughly separated by the same number of intermediate hops. This is the reason\r\nwhy complex networks are often considered as pure topological objects. Yet, many networks are embedded in metric spaces. Some are explicit, like in airport networks,\r\npower grids, or urban networks, whereas some are hidden, like in the Internet or in economic networks.\r\nThe discovery of such hidden metric spaces and the understanding of their role has become\r\na major research area within the field of complex networks and promise to contribute significantly\r\nto the major challenges of the field, namely, the predictability, control, and engineering of complex\r\nsystems. A germane example of the power of geometry in this context is our recent discovery of\r\nhidden metric spaces underlaying both the Internet graph and metabolic networks. In the case of\r\nthe Internet, such metric space provides a solution to the scalability limitations of current interdomain\r\nrouting protocols. In the case of metabolic networks, it allows us to redefine the concept\r\nof biological pathways and to quantify their crosstalk. Following this research, our proposal aims at developing the theoretical foundations of complex\r\nsystems embedded in (hidden) metric spaces to get insights into the connection between the\r\nstructure and function of complex systems. Elucidating this mysterious connection implies an impact\r\nfar broader than the Internet or metabolic networks, including for recommendation systems,\r\nsearch engines, social dynamics, epidemic spreading, cancer and brain research, protein folding,\r\nand drug design.

Traditional explanations lean towards one of two extremes. Some researchers argue that language acquisition is a highly specialized process relying on detailed domain-specific learning mechanisms and cognitive constraints defining the space of possible grammars.  Others claim that domain-general statistical learning mechanisms are sufficient to solve the problem. While statistical learning is surely involved, even a powerful statistical learner must be constrained (biased) somehow, since any finite data set contains many different statistical regularities, and the learner must know which are relevant to the task at hand. In my research, I aim to discover what cognitive constraints underlie language acquisition. These constraints determine the kinds of statistical information that are attended to, how different sources of information are combined, and what mental representations are used to store and generalize over this information. My working hypothesis is that successful language learning results from a combination of probabilistic inference (a domain-general statistical learning mechanism) and structured mental representations (potentially including some domain-specific ones). Furthermore, structured between different levels of linguistic structure, such as words and phonemes or syntax and semantics, are critical for learning at all levels. Any particular level of structure cannot be learned successfully in isolation; rather, partial knowledge at different levels is combined synergistically to aid learning at all levels. To formalize and test this hypothesis, I develop computational models that simulate learners with different kinds of constraints, exposed to different linguistic input—normally, transcripts of naturalistic child-directed speech. I then compare the output of these models to results from behavioral and observational studies of children. To date, my group has developed models implementing previously proposed synergistic interactions (e.g., syntactic-semantic learning) as well as illustrating new ones (e.g., lexical-phonetic learning). These models capture important behavioral effects and demonstrate that learning at multiple levels of structure need not entail a temporal ordering— first learn A, then use A to learn B. Rather, A and B can be learned simultaneously by using partial information about each to help learn the other. I plan to extend this work in three ways: first, by performing additional simulations on diverse languages to ensure the universality of these models and investigate how differences between languages affect the rate or patterns of learning. Second, by working to model interactions between more than two levels of structure, where the potential correspondences between levels are more complex, but there is also even more potential for synergy. Third, by relaxing some simplifying assumptions about the input to the models, so that they more closely simulate the challenges overcome by real children.

Of these, stopping action is the most tractable for cognitive  neuroscience research. An example of stopping action is your cancellation of  impending movement when you are about to step into the street and suddenly  notice a car bearing down. My research program has investigated this kind of action  stopping in detail, and has identified a core brain circuit. Now I plan to radically  extend this research program by asking whether this same stopping circuit also  underlies the control of thoughts, motivations and urges. Beyond actions, stopping also affects thought. One way this happens is \r\nanalogous to the experience of having a conversation interrupted by a surprising  event, resulting in a loss of one’s “train of thought.” In effect, the surprising event  recruits the brain’s stopping circuit and massively suppresses current cortical  contents. Motorically, this is the ‘jolt’ that can accompany rapid movement  cancellation; cognitively, this might actually erase the current goals. As the modern  world contains many irrelevant and surprising stimuli, this research tack offers a  compelling window into better understanding everyday distractibility. Most of us want to control excessive motivations towards things such as \r\ncookies, alcohol, or smartphones. But can stopping even be directed at the of  the stimulus rather than the motor tendency per se? One intriguing possibility,  suggested by our recent work, is that if people repeatedly practice stopping actions  toward such stimuli they can reduce their associated value. This could subsequently  diminish the motivating impact of a stimulus. Better understanding this effect would  have profound implications for behavior modification, especially for disorders such  as gambling and substance abuse. These examples all activate the stopping circuit rapidly. But can it also be \r\nactivated in an extended fashion, i.e. over seconds and minutes? I hypothesize that it  can, and that this is crucial to what makes something an urge. One interesting thing  about urges is that they have an inherent element of restraint. Showing that this  restraint relates to the stopping circuit would provide a neural-mechanistic  understanding of urges for the first time. Testing these ideas involves developing new behavioral paradigms, and  using methods that can measure the stopping circuit of the brain, as well as  stimulation methods that can prove that the stopping circuit is for diverse aspects of human self control well beyond merely stopping action.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - San Diego', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020375\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Usually,  if  we  observe  purposeful  behavior,  appropriate responses to sensory inputs, and above all appropriate answers to questions, we can be reasonably sure that the person is conscious. However, we know that consciousness can be entirely generated within the brain, even in the absence of any interaction with the external world; this happens almost every night, while we dream. The dissociation between consciousness and responsiveness is particularly relevant in the case of brain-injured patients who may emerge from coma with their eyes open, but immobile and not reacting to sensory stimulation. Yet, to this day, we still lack an objective, dependable measure of the level of  consciousness  that  is  independent  of  processing  sensory  inputs  and  producing  appropriate  motor outputs. To overcome this problem, one should directly assess brain properties that are necessary and sufficient for consciousness to emerge. Empirically, however, this task is fraught with challenges. Once again, one of the most striking paradoxes is offered by sleep. During early dreamless sleep, in fact, several brain parameters such  as  mean  firing  rates  and  synchronization  levels  are  comparable  to  quiet  wakefulness,  still consciousness is lost. My work is guided by theoretical principles suggesting that consciousness depends on the ability of neural elements to engage in complex activity patterns that are, at once, distributed within a system of interacting cortical areas (integrated) and differentiated in space and time (information-rich) (i.e. brain  complexity).  In  practice,  my  research  focuses  on  the  development  of  a  theory-driven empirical method to assess brain complexity based on a combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Over  the  last  ten  years,  we  tested  this  method  in  several  conditions  where  consciousness  was unambiguously present (wakefulness, dreaming, locked-in syndrome) or lost (NREM sleep, anesthesia, and vegetative  state  patients).  Invariably,  when  consciousness  was  present  a  direct  cortical  perturbation induced a widespread and reproducible response characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics. On the contrary, whenever consciousness was lost, the same perturbation induced simpler cortical activations that were either circumscribed to the stimulation site (loss of integration) or involved the entire cortical mantle at once (loss of information). Overall,  this  assessment  of  brain  complexity  seem  to  provide  a  reliable  measuring  scale  along  the unconsciousness/consciousness  spectrum.  This  represents  a  first  step  towards  a  robust  and  objective assessment  of  unresponsive  individuals  whose  level  of  consciousness  is  unknown.  Most  important,  a theoretical and empirical link between consciousness and complexity may shed new light on the cortical mechanisms that underlie loss and recovery of consciousness in pathological condition. TMS/EEG measures suggest that also in vegetative patients brain complexity may collapse through network bistability, as in sleep and anesthesia. Since bistability is, in principle, reversible and its mechanisms are well-understood at the cellular and network level, it may represent a suitable target for novel therapeutic approaches in patients in whom consciousness is impaired, in spite of preserved cortical activity.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Università degli Studi di Milano', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020369\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The theory of natural selection presupposes the existence of differentiated organisms that can compete. Organisms are highly organized structures. Where do these structures come from? Among scientists in the field of complexity research there is the growing conviction that there is a deep logic to the emergence of structure, and that order in the physical world is not happenstance but rather the ineluctable result of the flow of energy and matter across systems. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that an isolated system will degrade until every part of the system is the same. Conversely, an open system can exchange energy and matter with its environment, and can spontaneously develop structure from homogenous initial conditions. Based on a combination of carefully controlled experiments and theoretical analyses conducted over the latter part of the 20th century we now understand how and when structure develops in the simplest systems. These carefully controlled systems are known as pattern forming systems. A classic demonstration of pattern formation is a pot of water on a stove. If the stove is not turned on, the water remains still. The fluid is in equilibrium, and all parts behave the same; there is no structure. But if the heat is turned on, the water begins to move in an organized manner. The water rises along the walls of the pot and falls in the middle. From initially homogeneous conditions the water has developed an organized dynamical structure. The world is filled with countless examples of this general phenomenon from the mundane--the ornate architecture of a snow flake, the crown-like splash of a drop, the dark ring around a coffee strain--to the exotic--the Earth's magnetic field, sunspots, the large scale structure of the universe. Is life yet another example of structure emerging from uniformity? Notable scientists such as Stuart Kaufmann and Nobel Laureate Ilya Prigogine argue that it is indeed so. To paraphrase their argument, consider the analogy between the Earth and the heated pot of water. Like the pot, the Earth is in a thermal gradient between the hot Sun and cold interstellar space. Energy flows from the Sun to the Earth, and is reradiated from the Earth to empty space. Like the heated pot of water, the Earth is filled with structure: weather patterns, geological and geographical formations, and--the grandest of all, of course--living organisms. Ergo, as in the heated pot, the structure on Earth derives from the flow of energy. Implicit in this argument is an enormous extrapolation between the ordering seen in simple pattern forming systems, and the ordering seen in the world around us. The aim of my research is to bridge the disparity in complexity between the simple laboratory pattern forming systems and the large complex systems like the Earth. My research aim is to test the hypothesis that the difference in complexity between a pattern forming system and a large open system is quantitative, not qualitative; to show that the physical principles of self-organization exhibited by patterns in laboratory experiments are the same principles that give rise to the organization in world around us. Large open systems consist of many interacting subsystems. Hence, to test the hypothesis I will systematically investigate the change in the complexity as the number of subsystems increases and their interactions strengthen. For example, to mimic the Earth one could apply a single temperature gradient to a multi-component system. This is the approach I follow in one of my proposed experiments, the stacked Rayleigh-Benard system. The traditional Rayleigh-Benard system is a refined version of the boiling water example from above. A fluid is held between a cool upper plate and a warm lower plate. The temperature gradient, as in the heated pot of water, causes convective flow, but instead of producing a single giant convection roll, the Rayleigh-Benard system organizes in to patterns (e.g. stripes, hexagons, spirals) of rising and falling fluid. My experiment would stack several of these cells but would only set the temperature on the end plates. By varying the number of cells, the gap between each pair of plates and the thickness of the plates, the number of sub-systems and the strength of their interactions can be systematically explored. In addition to the scientific rationale, there are technological dividends to be expected from this research. Nanotechnology aspires to build materials and devices from the atom upward. Yet to build a single cubic centimeter of matter by individually placing each atom would take millions of years even at the speed of the fastest computers. Clearly, cleverer methods are needed. The current hope is that the self-organizing ability of matter can be leveraged. We know of only two instances in which matter self-organizes: at thermodynamic phase transitions, and in open driven systems (the subject of this essay). Of the two, the latter is the more flexible, and most widely employed. Hence, understanding the origin, mechanisms, and potential of self-organization in non-equilibrium systems is fundamental to advancing our engineering capabilities.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020172\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '446,545', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Moving to the beat has \r\nplayed a significant role in human culture for millennia, but the mechanism underlying beat \r\nperception is still a mystery. Existing models of time perception cannot account for many \r\nfeatures of beat perception, and behavioral evidence suggests that humans may have a unique \r\nbeat-based timing system. My research seeks to characterize this system. Thus far, my research \r\nindicates a link between beat perception and movement: brain areas that control movement \r\nrespond to rhythm, and certain motor areas respond specifically during beat perception, even \r\nwhen no movement is made. My research will continue to investigate the beat-based system with \r\nthree inter-related streams that aim to: i) understand the neural mechanisms of rhythm and beat \r\nperception, ii) compare brain responses across species, assessing whether beat perception is truly \r\nunique to humans, iii) exploit beat-based mechanisms for gait interventions in movement \r\ndisorders. The first stream will examine what roles are played by the individual motor areas that \r\nrespond during rhythm and beat perception. Some roles may be general to all types of timing, \r\nwhereas others may be specific to beat-based timing. To investigate this, I will apply noninvasive \r\nbrain stimulation to transiently disrupt functioning in individual motor areas, measuring how \r\neach supports timing and beat perception. Most non-human primates can time the short intervals that make up rhythms, but appear insensitive to the beat. Beat perception may be unique to humans, or primates may perceive the beat, but have not been tested with paradigms that can demonstrate beat sensitivity. Therefore, I will compare brain responses in humans and other primates to beat-based sequences and nonbeat-based sequences, using non-invasive 7 Tesla MRI. If the brains of other primates distinguish beat and nonbeat sequences, this challenges the currently held view that beat perception is uniquely human. In humans, beat perception not only activates motor areas, but enhances communication \r\nbetween auditory and motor areas in the brain, providing a pathway by which sound can \r\ninfluence movement. My third research stream will exploit this connection, characterizing how \r\nselected rhythmic and musical characteristics alter walking, enabling us to select optimal music \r\nfeatures for gait interventions for patients with movement disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease. \r\nI will also characterize the neural pathways that enable different features of music and rhythm \r\nfeatures to improve movement at an individual level. Currently, patients’ responses to musical \r\ngait interventions vary widely. My goal is to assess and account for these individual differences \r\nand thus tailor musical interventions to individual patients. Understanding the neurobiological foundations of beat perception and rhythm will shape \r\nfuture theories about our fundamental timing capacities and their underlying mechanisms. \r\nDetermining whether some capacities, such as beat-based timing, are uniquely human will be \r\ncrucial to creating accurate models of timing and temporal perception. These models will have \r\nwidespread applicability, as temporal perception underlies our capacity to integrate information \r\nfrom different senses, coordinate movement, and perceive relationships in the world.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The University of Western Ontario', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020403\\n', 'year': '2014', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Although evolutionary theory can\r\nretrospectively explain many cases of adaptation and genetic drift, predicting the trajectories of\r\nspecific populations remains difficult. Is prediction merely limited by incomplete knowledge of\r\nselective pressures and functional constraints, or is evolution so strongly affected by chance\r\nthat prediction is effectively impossible? The answers to these questions determine the\r\ninferences we draw from current populations, the type of data we collect, and the kinds of\r\noutcomes we plan for. The problem of predicting evolution underlies a central mystery of adaptive immunity. When\r\nencountering a pathogen, B cells begin mutating rapidly and undergo intense selection for\r\nimproved pathogen binding. B cells with good binding later secrete high-affinity antibodies,\r\nwhich help clear infection. B cells can bind any number of sites, such that some cells bind sites\r\nthat disrupt essential activities, while others do less damage. Which sites B cells evolve to\r\nrecognize thus affects protection against current and future pathogens. B cells that neutralize\r\npathogens are more protective, and B cells that target evolutionarily conserved sites may confer\r\nbroader immunity. Actual B cell repertoires vary among individuals in ways that cannot be\r\nexplained simply by individuals’ unique histories of infection. Some sites are recognized by a\r\nfew people and other sites by nearly everyone. To immunologists, this is the problem of\r\nimmunodominance. The aim of the proposed work is to investigate the fitness landscape on which B cells evolve to\r\na common pathogen, which will reveal the role of chance in evolution and show how immune\r\nrepertoires are shaped by infection. B cells provide a unique context for studying evolution on\r\nadaptive landscapes: they evolve very quickly by point mutations, their fitnesses can be easily\r\ndefined and measured as binding affinities to proteins, they are abundant, ancestral forms can\r\nbe reconstructed, and their population structure naturally provides several forms of experimental\r\nreplication. An investigation of B cell evolution could thus yield the most comprehensive survey\r\nto date of an adaptive landscape, allowing the roles of chance, accessibility, and convergence in\r\nevolution to be evaluated statistically. Moreover, this adaptive landscape is of great importance\r\nto pathogen evolution and public health. Adaptive immunity shapes the diversity of many\r\npathogens, including influenza and HIV. Tremendous effort has been dedicated to studying how\r\nbroadly neutralizing antibodies to such pathogens may be induced. Such antibodies naturally\r\narise in a subset of the infected population, and vaccines that attempt to boost their numbers\r\nare in development. However, it is not known how extensively antibody repertoires can be\r\nshaped or if there are consequences of homogenizing herd immunity for viral evolution.

In the 17th century, without any technology reminiscent of human cognitive capabilities, Cartesian dualism, in which the human mind stood outside the realm of physical laws governing the human body, ruled the day.  In the 20th century,  with the advent of Turing computation,  the analogy of the mind as a computer dominated.  More recent advances in statistical machine learning have yielded exceedingly interesting Bayesian formalisms for quantifying sensorimotor and cognitive behavior. In the 21st century, what technologies will further drive theories of human cognition? I believe the transformative technologies will not be artificial computing algorithms that provide metaphors for the mind, but physical technologies that can probe and perturb the biophysics of the brain. Indeed recent experimental revolutions in neuroscience have opened new vistas into immensely complex dynamical processes spanning many spatiotemporal scales, ranging from molecular dynamics  to  global neural activity  patterns  during behavior.  These new experimental  windows,  amplified  and empowered  by national  brain initiatives,  now allow us to  address  one of the  most striking conundrums  in modern science:  how do the  cognitive capacities of the mind emerge from the biological wet-ware of the brain?  However, experiment alone cannot answer this question; to obtain a meaningful understanding of such complex data, we desperately  need integrative theories and new mathematical frameworks to concisely describe how important behaviors like perception, action, learning and memory emerge from the cooperative activity of high-dimensional, multi-scale neural processes. My laboratory is dedicated to generating and testing such theories in close collaboration with experimentalists. In particular, two interrelated goals of my laboratory are (1) Elucidate how cognitive  behaviors  emerge from the  microscopic  dynamics  of neurons  and synapses embedded  in networks; (2) Develop methods  in high dimensional  statistics and machine learning to extract meaningful predictive models of cognitive and sensorimotor phenomena from large neuroscientific datasets. Indeed my career has been defined by an intense desire to understand how non-intuitive macroscopic phenomena emerge from microscopic dynamics. For example, during my PhD in string theory, I explored how the geometry of space-time itself could emerge from statistical interactions in large non-geometric objects. Building on this rigorous training, my lab and I employ and invent a broad arsenal of theoretical tools from physics,  mathematics,  engineering,  statistics  and computer  science  to  develop  new conceptual frameworks for describing the relation between biophysics and behavior across many scales of biological organization. We have achieved several successes along these lines, including understanding how attention, decision making, sequence memory, sensorimotor learning, and semantic learning can all emerge naturally from distributed, plastic neuronal circuits.  In the future, we will build on these successes to explore several research directions,  including how synaptic complexity contributes to learning and memory, how distributed plasticity in sensorimotor loops gives rise to imitation learning, how collective motor cortical dynamics generates complex movements and plans, and how the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep neuronal networks can\r\nyield mathematical laws of human semantic cognition.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Stanford University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020402\\n', 'year': '2014', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The options for treatment are limited. Sadly, many brain tumors are fatal. The most common brain tumors are the glioma and the meningioma. Scientists know a lot about gliomas, but not much about how meningiomas form. Meningiomas are slow growing tumors that are attached to the dura, a covering that surrounds the brain. These tumors are common in people in their sixties and seventies, particularly in women. Although most are benign cancers, meningiomas can grow into the brain, spread along the dural covering, and even metastasize to the lungs, liver and bone. Meningiomas often develop in people who have been exposed to radiation. Aggressive surgery is currently the best treatment. No chemotherapy has been proven effective. Since people who have the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). frequently develop meningioma, scientists have focused their attention on whether the NF2 gene plays a role in meningioma formation. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently detected genetic alteration in meningiomas. The NF2 gene is a member of the Protein 4.1 family of membrane-associated proteins. Recently, our laboratory has identified two additional Protein 4.1 tumor suppressor genes, 4.1B and 4.1R, that are also inactivated in meningiomas. To find out how important the NF2 gene is in the formation of meningiomas, we used a specially designed virus to inactivate the NF2 gene in meningeal cells in the dural brain lining of mice. We found that when NF2 expression was lost, meningiomas formed. Our NF2 mouse model represents a significant advance as the first and only small animal meningioma model. However, the frequency of meningioma formation is low, and there are some serious limitations with the viral NF2 inactivation approach we used. If we could develop a better model, the entire community of meningioma researchers could move forward and answer questions that have challenged scientists for many years. Based on our encouraging initial discoveries, we have initiated an international collaborative research program to develop robust preclinical mouse models of meningioma. In this proposal, we have three specific objectives. First, we will employ several additional strategies to generate mice that develop meningioma at higher frequency. In these studies, we will generate two strains of genetically-engineered mice that can be used to inactivate certain tumor suppressor genes in meningeal cells. We will use these new mouse strains to inactivate the NF2 or 4.1B gene specifically in meningeal cells. This will allow us to develop mouse models for the two most common genetic abnormalities in human meningiomas. Second, we propose to generate mice in which combinations of genetic alterations will be introduced in meningeal cells in living animals. This will allow us to develop mouse models of high-grade malignant meningioma. Lastly, the ultimate goal of these studies is to generate mouse models of meningioma that are suitable for evaluating potential chemotherapies. In this regard, we will study benign and malignant mouse meningiomas using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At Washington University, we have access to one of the finest imaging centers in the world. We will collaborate with our colleagues in the Universitys Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, which houses two dedicated state-of-the-art small animal MRI machines. If we are successful in accomplishing these ambitious goals, the genetically engineered mouse strains we create for benign and malignant meningiomas will afford usand scientists elsewhere who grapple with the same issuesthe unique opportunity to begin translational research studies. We will be able to evaluate the clinical behavior of these tumors in mice, identify additional meningioma therapeutic targets for future drug design, and evaluate potential meningioma therapies. The availability of these genetically engineered mice will greatly accelerate the development and assessment of potential therapies for this important brain cancer in humans.

These tumors grow aggressively and infiltrate surrounding normal brain. Even after microsurgical resection, they recur from these infiltrating elements of residual tumors. Immunotherapy for cancers has been developed on the notion that a patients immune system may be able to distinguish cancer cells as abnormal tissues and attack microscopic small elements of cancers. Indeed, cancer cells produce many proteins that are not usually produced by normal tissues. Investigators for other types of cancers have developed vaccine strategies in which they induce specific immune responses against proteins called tumor-associated antigens. Early reports from these studies have demonstrated safety, feasibility and some level of efficacy of these approaches. The central nervous system (CNS) and CNS tumors have long been regarded as immunologically privileged due to their distinctive anatomical characteristics such as the absence of conventional draining lymphatics and the presence of the blood-brain-barrier. Nonetheless, the immunologic privilege of the brain is not absolute, and our understanding of neuro-immunology has actually been extensively revised in the last several years. For instance, in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is an animal disease model simulating multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans, peripheral immunization with brain specific proteins elicits antigen specific, T-lymphocyte-mediated auto-immune brain disease. This clearly indicates that specific immunoreactivity in the CNS can result from the appropriate presentation of target antigen and the efficient induction of a systemic effector response. This observation is further strengthened by recent reports that effective anti-CNS tumor immune responses can be generated through the use of cytokine (a type of immuno-stimulatory substances) -gene modified tumor cell vaccines. We have developed clinical trials of vaccine therapies using patients own glioma cells that are genetically modified to produce a cytokine, interleukin-4 (IL-4). We have treated two patients with this strategy, and have observed some level of clinical response in each patient. Although these whole glioma cell vaccines appear to be promising, there is a theoretical concern for inducing immune responses against normal brain compartments because glioma cells and normal brain cells express many common proteins. One way to limit this attack on healthy brain tissues is to prime immunity against tumor specific antigens. To date, few human gliomaspecific antigens have been identified. However, we recently reported identification of one of the first glioma-derived T-cell epitopes, which are small pieces of proteins (peptides) capable of inducing cytotoxic T cell-immune responses specifically against brain tumors. We have incorporated cutting-edge bioinformatics and immunobiology to establish an efficient system to identify these immunogenic molecules. It is thought to be very important to expand the number of available CTL epitopes for therapy of human gliomas because immunotherapy against a single antigen epitope is likely to result in outgrowth of antigen-loss variant tumors because the antigen-profile of human glioma cells are different each other even in the same individual. In this proposal, we will extend our approach in order to identify more glioma antigen-epitopes. These peptides will be identified within the proteins that are strongly expressed in brain tumors, and ones that have altered amino-acid sequences in brain tumor cells. We already have one candidate antigen called EphA2. We have recently shown it to be expressed in many human malignant gliomas. Therefore, identification of CTL epitopes in EphA2 may allow us to treat malignant gliomas with specific vaccines. In order to identify glioma associated antigen-derived epitopes, we will use computer programs that will help us to predict epitopes that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that present epitopes to T-cells. Synthetic peptides for these predicted sequences will be then loaded on donor-derived dendritic cells (DCs) that are sometimes called quarterbacks in the immune system because of their important roles in presenting antigens to T-cells and activating them. We will co-culture the peptide-loaded DCs and T-cells in order to find whether these peptides are able to elicit specific T-cell responses. If we find any response, these T-cells will be tested for their killing ability against human glioma cells that express the antigens. Some immunologists have also reported that introduction of alterations in amino-acid sequences of the antigen peptides may even enhance the efficiency of immune-priming ability; and T-cell responses induced by such altered peptides may still recognize the original form of antigen-peptides on the target cells. In order to develop even more effective vaccine strategies, we will also investigate whether peptides that have artificial alterations in amino-acid sequences can elicit even more efficient immune responses against human glioma-derived antigens. We believe it is also important to demonstrate that anti-glioma T-cell responses can be elicited with these peptide-epitopes in glioma patient-derived T-cells in vitro because we eventually plan to develop peptide-based vaccine protocols for these patients. We will therefore test in vitro whether these peptides can elicit immuno-reactivity in T-cells obtained from glioma patients. In addition, we plan to use these peptides to measure anti-glioma immunity elicited in patients who participated in our IL-4 glioma vaccine trials. We expect to find that specific T-cell immuno-reactivity may increase following glioma-cell vaccines, and such responses may correlate with clinical responses. Our ultimate goal of this proposal, although not directly a part of the proposal, is to design and conduct peptide-based vaccines against malignant gliomas using the epitope-peptides identified in the proposed study. We envision the use of DCs loaded with the peptide-epitopes as vaccines. Peptide-based vaccines are expected to have the following advantages over our ongoing whole glioma cell vaccines: 1) because of its specificity, there will be less concern of inducing auto-immune reaction to normal brain; 2) in contrast to whole cell vaccines that require resection of significant amount of tumor tissue and cumbersome laboratory work for cellprocessing, large amounts of synthetic peptides will be available in a timely fashion; and 3) if we find modified peptides that are more efficient in inducing responses, vaccines with these epitopes may be more efficient than whole natural glioma cells. We are confident in proposing these projects because of the extensive experience in this field at the University of Pittsburgh.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Pittsburgh Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020036\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The mortality rate for these cancers remains over 70%. The most aggressive of these cancers, glioblastoma, accounts for nearly half of these cancers. There has been little increase over the past few decades in the survival rate of patients with glioblastoma. Patients rarely live more than 3 years after diagnosis. New insights into the biology and origin of glioblastoma are required to devise more effective therapies. Emerging work from a number of laboratories suggests that there are remarkable parallels between the proliferation of cancer cells and the proliferation of normal stem cells. Indeed, many cancers may arise from mutations that transform normal stem cells. These findings suggest that we may be able to better understand and treat cancer by better understanding the proliferation and survival of normal stem cells. This raises the possibility of gaining insights into cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) by learning more about normal CNS stem cells. CNS stem cells persist in the brain throughout life and give rise to new neurons and glia. Very few cells within the adult brain are capable of proliferating, and stem cells are the most proliferative of these cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that the genes that regulate the proliferation of normal stem cells are the same genes that cause cancer when mutated. Unfortunately, we know very little about how the proliferation of normal stem cells is regulated. Nonetheless, many scientists hypothesize that if we could learn more about the proliferation of normal stem cells that we would gain novel insights into how cancer cells co-opt these same pathways to proliferate in an uncontrolled way. This could improve our ability to identify, diagnose, and treat cancer. Our laboratory has recently discovered that an oncogene called bmi-1 is a critical regulator of the proliferation of normal CNS stem cells. We are proposing to study how bmi-1 promotes the proliferation of CNS stem cells, and whether amplified production of bmi-1 leads to brain cancers such as glioblastoma. We have discovered that bmi-1 regulates the proliferation of a variety of different types of stem cells, including CNS stem cells, in very similar ways. In fact, bmi-1 appears to promote stem cell proliferation in two ways. First, bmi-1 turns off other genes that directly impair proliferation. The first aim of our research will be to identify the genetic pathway that is turned off in stem cells by bmi-1 to promote proliferation. bmi-1 also appears to turn off genes that initiate the maturation of stem cells into specialized brain cells. Because specialized brain cells, like neurons, usually do not divide, this maturation process eliminates their ability to proliferate. The second aim of our research will be to identify pathways that are turned off by bmi-1 to inhibit the process of maturation. By identifying genes that directly and indirectly inhibit proliferation and that are turned off by bmi-1 in stem cells, we will begin to elucidate the molecular pathways that regulate the proliferation of normal CNS stem cells. These pathways have a major effect on the proliferation of stem cells as in the absence of bmi-1, stem cells become severely depleted and are unable to persist in normal numbers into adult life. Some of the genes in a pathway that is regulated by bmi-1 have already been shown to be deleted in a surprisingly large proportion of brain cancers. Because these genes impair proliferation, mutations that delete these genes contribute to the ability of cancer cells to proliferate in an uncontrolled way. But nobody has yet examined whether additional brain cancers might be explained by mutations that increase the production of bmi-1. Certain other types of cancer, such as in the blood-forming system, have been linked to increased bmi-1 production. Thus the third aim of our research will be to examine whether bmi-1 production is abnormally increased in a subset of brain cancers. If so, this would begin to explain how these brain cancers develop. Increased production of bmi-1 could make cancer cells unusually aggressive given bmi-1s powerful ability to turn off many genes that directly and indirectly impair proliferation. If we identify bmi-1-dependent pathways that regulate the proliferation of CNS stem cells and brain cancer cells it would not only improve our understanding of these important scientific questions, but it would suggest new therapeutic targets that could be exploited in treating brain cancer. For example, bmi-1 turns genes off by modifying the structure of DNA, so its effects might be countered by using drugs that inhibit its ability to modify DNA structure. Most importantly, if brain cancer cells use the same mechanism to proliferate as CNS stem cells then it will be possible to continue to generate novel insights into this mechanism by studying the regulation of stem cell proliferation. Ultimately we hope that it will be possible to exploit our understanding of stem cell proliferation by developing new therapies for brain cancers.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2003', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Clinically, GBM can be divided into two groups: primary and secondary GBM. Primary GBM arises quickly without prior sign of symptoms and has a median survival of less than a year. In contrast, the secondary GBM develops progressively from low-grade astrocytoma over a period of 5-10 years. Sadly, the prognosis for primary GBM has not changed during the past two decades due to a lack of insight into the molecular basis of the diseases and appropriate animal models. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is a promising candidate for being involved in human GBM. PTEN is frequently mutated in up to 40% of GBMs and alterations in the cellular machinery controlled by PTEN are known to be associated with many human types of cancers.

Analogous to normal stem cells, cancer stem cells have the capacity for indefinite proliferation and the ability to give rise to new abnormal tissues through self-renewal and differentiation. The key difference between normal and cancer stem cells may be due to the disregulated stem cell self-renewal and proliferation/survival, through accumulated mutations. The fact that cells from human GBMs resemble immature undifferentiated brain cells morphologically, and share some of the biological markers present in the neural stem cells has raised an interesting hypothesis that the origin of primary GBM may be mutated forms of neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult brain. Analyzing animals with a brain-specific PTEN deletion, we demonstrated that the PTEN tumor suppressor negatively regulates neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. Interestingly, the differentiation program of PTEN deficient neural stem cell is largely undisturbed, which fits well with the concept of cancer stem cells. However, few experiments have conducted to test whether PTEN is also important in regulating adult neural stem cells, a stage when primary GBM develops. We will address this question by specifically deleting PTEN in areas of the adult brain that harbor neural stem cells. We will follow the fate of the progenies derived from PTEN deficient stem cells and assess their potential to become cancerous cells. GBM development is a multi-step process, involving different genetic abnormalities. To understand how PTEN will collaborate with other important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in regulating brain tumor formation, we plan to generate animal models with a combination of PTEN deletion and other genetic alterations. As an example of our general approach, we will delete both PTEN and NF1 tumor suppressor genes in the mouse brain, which will perturb the two most common signaling pathways regulated by growth factors and their receptor tyrosine kinases. Mapping the molecular events leading to GBM will provide more specific and efficient targets to cancer therapy. To this end, we have used mice with brain PTEN deletion to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of drugs specifically inhibiting PTEN controlled signaling pathways. PTEN negatively regulates mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin), a master regulator of cellular growth. We showed that PTEN mutated brains are hypersensitive to rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. Significantly, rapamycin treatment led to partial rescue of the abnormalities associated with PTEN deletion, such as progressive increase in brain size and brain pressure, altered brain structure, and subsequent lethality. We will continue this effort and further evaluate the efficacy of single and combined treatment procedures. It is our hope that this basic research will provide both insights into molecular mechanisms of GBM and valuable models for evaluating potential treatments.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Los Angeles', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020038\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This is exemplified by the cocktail party problem, which raises the question of how an individual attends to a single person speaking in a crowded cocktail party, amidst a cacophony of other voices and sounds. An essential step in solving this problem is identifying and perceptually segregating auditory objects, analogous to perceptually grouping objects in visual scenes. In this vein the general problem has been termed 'auditory scene analysis'[1]. In the cocktail party example, one must segregate the voice of the person to whom they are listening. Once segregated from extraneous sounds (background noise), the object of interest (foreground signal) can be further analyzed. In the above example the listener can analyze the speech signal (the foreground sound) coming from the person of interest, while ignoring the cocktail party background. Determining how the brain solves this type of problem has far-reaching societal significance both in terms of the human condition and voice and speech recognition systems. While brains of young healthy individuals can solve the problem rather easily, elderly and developmentally impaired individuals have difficulty isolating and analyzing sound sources. It is well known that elderly people with hearing aids have particular difficulty functioning in acoustically complex noisy environments like cocktail parties. What is less known is that this difficulty is a general affliction of many elderly, even older people without the high frequency hearing loss also associated with aging. That is one reason that turning up the amplification in hearing aids cannot treat auditory scene analysis problems. As the population ages this problem will become more prevalent. Dyslexic individuals also suffer from difficulty perceptually grouping and analyzing sounds in noisy environments. Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying auditory scene analysis will help us mitigate related problems encountered by aging and dyslexic individuals, and the social isolation often associated with them. Also, the computations underlying auditory scene analysis, which the brain of healthy humans performs with little effort by the person, has eluded engineers trying to build speech and voice recognition systems. Accordingly, such systems require quiet, simple acoustical environments to operate well. Increasing the understanding of how the brain solves the auditory scene analysis problem will help engineers design better systems for speech recognition. Within the context of auditory scene analysis an interesting phenomenon, , occurs when a foreground sound is interrupted by noise. If a foreground sound (such as speech, an FM glide, or a tone) is interrupted by noise (such as a cough), subjects hear the foreground continuing through the noise, even at noise intensities loud enough that the foreground sound can not be heard over the noise. Why doesn't the interrupting noise make the foreground less perceptible? Because the nervous system 'fills-in' missing information (i.e., creates an illusion). This can be demonstrated when silent 'gaps' are introduced into a foreground, and loud noise bursts are superimposed during the silence. Under these conditions, subjects perceive the foreground as continuing through the noise, even though the foreground signal that should have occurred during the noise was deleted (review in [1]). Studying illusions such as fill-in is scientifically valuable because of the incongruity between the physical stimulus and the percept. Investigators can exploit this incongruity to determine where in the brain neural activity becomes more strongly associated with the illusory percept than the physical stimulus. When neural responses closely related to the illusory percept are found, this relationship can be used to advance the understanding of how brain mechanisms create the perception. We propose to identify the neuronal contribution to perception, specifically to auditory fill-in, by investigating perception and single unit responses from auditory cortex. Investigations of complex perceptions and illusions in the auditory system of animals are rare. Of course, relating single neuron firing patterns to perceptual and cognitive function is difficult. If the behavioral and physiological experiments are not carefully designed and implemented, interpretations can be severely compromised. Making quantitative comparisons also requires care. For example, a single neuron's ability to detect or discriminate a sound parameter on any single stimulus presentation depends not only on the mean response, but also on the trial-to-trial response variability. In visual system studies, powerful statistical techniques (using signal detection theory) that account for neuronal response variability have demonstrated direct links between single neuron responses and perception (e.g., [2]), yet a similar approach in the auditory system remains relatively untapped. We propose to apply and extend these techniques to auditory cortical studies of fill-in. By combining behavior and physiology, carefully framing the behavioral question, and using rigorous quantitative techniques we will determine neural correlates of fill-in using analyses that allow for direct comparisons of auditory cortical neurons' responses to behavioral performance of monkeys. The results will significantly advance the understanding of neural response contributions to auditory perceptions and decision-making. This new direction of the lab's research is novel by using experimental and analytical techniques established from visual cortical studies and applying them to a new problem: determining the neural correlates of an auditory illusion. By using an auditory illusion we can identify what parts of the brain are involved in creating percepts that deviate significantly from the world, and therefore how the brain creates unique perceptions. Experiments combining psychophysical and single-unit physiology to quantitatively investigate the link between neural activity and auditory perception are virtually non-existent. Outside of sound localization, to our knowledge, no attempt has been made to investigate high-level perceptual and illusory phenomena, such as fill-in or other aspects of auditory scene analysis, with such an approach. However the potential gains, in terms of advancing the understanding of the neural substrates of auditory processing, are tremendous and therefore motivate taking this different approach to investigating auditory cortex.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Davis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020042\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '449,696', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Indeed, the increase in the size of the cortical sheet and cortical field number is one of the hallmarks of human brain evolution. Fossil records and comparative studies of the neocortex indicate that early mammalian neocorticies were composed of only a few parts or cortical fields, and that in some lineages such as primates, the neocortex expanded dramatically. More significantly, the number of cortical fields increased and the connectivity between cortical fields became more complex. While we do not know the exact transformation between this type of increase in cortical field number and connectivity, and the emergence of complex behaviors like those mentioned above, we know that species that have large neocorticies with multiple parts generally have more complex behaviors, both overt and covert. While a number of inroads have been made into understanding how neurons in the neocortex respond to avariety of stimuli, the micro and macro circuitry of particular neocortical fields, and the molecular developmental events that construct current organization, very little is known about how more cortical fields are added in evolution. In particular, we do not know the rules of change, nor the constraints imposed on evolving nervous systems that dictate the particular phenotype that will ultimately emerge. One reason why these issues are unresolved is that the brain is a compromise between existing genetic constraints, and the need to adapt. Thus, the functions that the brain generates are absolutely imperfect, although functionally optimized. This makes it very difficult to determine the rules of construction, to generate viable computational models of brain evolution, and to predict the direction of changes that may occur over time. Despite these obstacles, it is still possible to study the evolution of the neocortex. One way is to study the products of the evolutionary process, extant mammal brains, and to make inferences about the process. We have successfully used this comparative approach in a variety of mammals to generate a number of theories regarding how the process of evolution generates a complex neocortex. The second way to study brain evolution is to examine the developmental mechanisms that give rise to complex brains. The series of experiments proposed here are designed to test the theories regarding cortical evolution, generated from comparative studies, by tweaking in a developing nervous system what we believe is naturally being modified in evolution. Our goals are to identify the constraints imposed on the evolving neocortex, to disentangle the genetic and activity dependent mechanisms that give rise to complex brains, and ultimately to produce a cortical phenotype that is consistent with what would naturally occur in evolution. There are three types of experiments planned. The first is to increase the size of the cortical sheet in the developing marsupial brain (Monodelphis domestica, and to examine the resulting cortex using electrophysiological recording techniques, neuroanatomical tracing methods, and molecular techniques. We know that an increase in the size of the cortical sheet is a necessary step in generating a complex brain, but we do not know if it is sufficient to induce new cortical fields to form. These experiments will allow us to appreciate if cortical fields simply get larger, or if new fields are added when the cortical sheet size is increased. The second type of experiment will be to examine the extent to which changes in peripheral morphology, and the patterned activity they generate can alter the cortical phenotype. In these experiments, peripheral manipulations in the form of ablations and transplants will be done, and the resulting cortex examined using electrophysiological recording techniques, neuroanatomical tracing methods, and molecular techniques. The final experiment will be to examine the spatial and temporal pattern of selected genes in two highly derived animals, the echo-locating bat and the naked mole rat, and to compare these patterns with those of the mouse. These animals have a small cortical sheet, like the mouse, but the organization of cortical fields on the sheet is vastly different. These differences are related to changes in their peripheral morphology and associated use. Patterns of gene expression will be examined prior to and after the arrival of thalamocortical afferents, which carry patterned activity from peripheral sensory receptor arrays. Studying highly derived animals offers an ideal opportunity to appreciate the genetic and activity dependent mechanisms that contribute to cortical field construction in an exaggerated form.

Consider a trial-and-error decision task such as an animal foraging for food or a human practicing chess. An early behaviorist proposal, due to Thorndike, was that such learning is limited to action propensities. On this view, successful actions (those followed by reward) are or reinforced as stimulus-response , and more likely to be repeated later. The refutation of this narrow view of action animated the cognitive revolution. Tolman, for instance, argued that organisms are not doomed merely to repeat previously successful behaviors, but can learn about the structure of a task (a \"cognitive map\" of a maze- the strategy favored by a chess opponent) and draw on this knowledge to evaluate even novel actions: new routes or moves. Surprisingly, this debate has not been resolved -- indeed, there is evidence that both sorts of mechanism coexist -- and the same ideas suffuse contemporary thinking. In neuroscience, Thorndike's notion of reinforcement stamping in habits persists in prominent computational hypotheses of the action of the neurochemical dopamine in striatum. This same reinforcement mechanism is widely invoked in relation to the compulsive effects of drugs of abuse, which affect dopamine.  In my lab, we are making fresh progress on these venerable questions by leveraging two technical innovations. . My doctoral training is in computer science, where research in reinforcement learning has developed a range of approaches to trial-and-error learning about decisions. This area offers a taxonomy of precise hypotheses for how the brain could approach this problem. In the last decade, one class of reinforcement learning algorithm has had dramatic success explaining the activity of dopamine neurons and their putative action driving habit learning. In an influential theoretical article, we proposed that a second class of algorithms, called model-based reinforcement learning, could provide a similarly quantitative account of the more poorly understood cognitive or deliberative, map-based learning strategy. . Classic approaches study learning curves to examine net changes over many trials. Computational algorithms, in contrast, are trial-by-trial hypotheses about how decision preferences should adapt following each trial's feedback. They may be tested directly for trial-by-trial fit to raw choice sequences, measuring (for instance) the differential contribution of different sorts of learning. Similarly, they provide dynamic predictions about otherwise subjective quantities hypothesized to underlie the decisions -- for instance, subjects' expectations about rewards -- which can analogously be tested against decision-related neural signals. Together, these new hypotheses and new ways of testing them have delivered a rich picture of habit learning. Future work in my lab focuses on extending these techniques toward a similarly detailed understanding of more cognitive decision learning, and how this interacts with habits.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'New York University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020291\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Some of the best-studied examples include the chemotaxis genetic network, which bacteria use to sense and move up nutrient gradients, and the regulon by which yeast adapt to changes in sugar availability [1, 2]. Such genetic networks can be classified as a type of survival strategy, known as , which involves sensing an environmental fluctuation and coordinating the induction and repression of specific genes in response to the change. To date, hundreds of such sensor-response modalities have been elucidated [3]. Microorganisms, however, possess another important type of survival strategy, known as [4, 5], which operates without any sensory system, and allows cells spontaneously to induce particular genes, and repress others. One prime example is the persistence stochastic switch in , whereby cells switch spontaneously into a slow-growing state, known as the , which allows survival of antibiotics and other environmental stresses [6-8]. The rate with which cells make this switch is extremely low, on the order of one switch per 10 cells per cell division. Thus, a tiny subpopulation of antibiotic-tolerant E.coli cells is maintained within a large population of antibiotic-sensitive cells. Such switches are prevalent in bacteria [9, 10] and in fungi [11-13] including in pathogenic strains and organisms, where they are believed to increase microbial survival rates under antimicrobial stresses. We previously introduced and analyzed a population dynamics model of phenotypic switching (both stochastic and responsive) [14]. The stochastic switching population adapts to fluctuating conditions by selective expansions of small subpopulations that are already pre-adapted to the new condition, and are maintained in the population before the change occurs (see Figure 1 of Proposal). The responsive switching population does not maintain diversity, and does not rely on selective expansions for population-level adaptation. Instead, each organism independently switches to the appropriate phenotype via sensory pathways. For stochastic switches, switching rates are typically much smaller than the growth rates ( phenotypic states are heritable but reversible), and exhibit little or no dependence on the environmental state; while for responsive switches, they are typically faster than growth rates and exhibit a strong dependence on the environmental state. Both responsive and stochastic switching strategies allow cells to change their state, or phenotype, to one that is appropriate for specific environmental conditions. This leads to the following fundamental biological question: How do evolution and ecology influence the repertoire of phenotypic switching strategies employed by any given microorganism? More specifically, why are some genes regulated by stochastic switching and others by responsive switching? And, more broadly, what can the repertoire of phenotypic switching strategies employed by a microorganism tell us about its natural environment? By developing and analyzing mathematical models, in combination with experiments, we have begun to answer these complex questions.

Darwin describes in exquisite detail adaptations by orchids to bait and use insects for dispersing their pollen. He focuses on the perfection and cunningness of these adaptations, but were these adaptations a product of the coevolving species only? The coevolutionary paradigm rests on a simple logic: individual organisms not only have to cope with their physio-chemical environments, but also must confront other evolving organisms, be this consuming them as resources, fighting them off as predators or parasites, cooperating with them as mutualists, or competing with them for resources or for reproductive opportunities. Failure at any of these can result in a shortened life-span and reduced reproductive output. This means that species interactions will have demographic consequences, and should there be heritable variation for traits, evolutionary consequences too. Insofar as biological form and function are imprints of environments, coevolution presents the unique possibility that different species are, in part, dynamically changing imprints of one another. Coevolutionary dynamics play themselves out in time and in space. In time because the selection involved may occur over many generations or even perpetually. In space because adaptations at a certain place and at a certain time can be 'transmitted' via migration or gene flow to other sites, where they may compete with resident phenotypes and, if more successful, out-compete local adaptations. Developing theory to obtain an understanding of these processes is very challenging. First, environments are complex: they are composed of many abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity, as well as biotic ones in the form of communities of interacting species. Moreover, environments vary in space and in time, and the grain of this variation itself may be variable. Second, individuals of most species can move either within or between spatially isolated populations, change phenotypically during their lives, and differ genetically from individual to individual within a population. Given this complexity, how predictable is coevolution? That is, to what extent will the same coevolutionary processes from the same initial conditions act in the same way to produce the same individual and community structures? To what extent do environments outside of a coevolving species interaction drive pattern in adaptation and biodiversity? If pattern is significantly influenced by variation in the interacting species themselves, is this explained by vagile or more conservatively expressed genes and traits? Are there types of coevolutionary interaction that are more likely to show stronger pattern than others? What happens to coevolution when trophic complexity is included? These questions are central to evolutionary biology, but are far from being resolved. Part of the reason is because we are yet to develop the theoretical framework necessary to obtain answers that match both pattern and process in natural systems. A few studies have ventured into this domain, but none have assessed the many sources of complexity in any systematic way. Moreover, although we are starting to tease apart coevolutionary pattern from laboratory and field examples, we haven't gone beyond the initial stages of inquiry, because we are either observing, or manipulating single or small numbers of factors. Should there be complex interactions between factors contributing to pattern, we may be reaching conclusions that are either incorrect or lack generality. My argument is that we need to examine coevolutionary systems at different entry points in order to obtain an assessment of the factors driving their pattern. We can approach this by identifying and understanding environmental variables one at a time, or in simple combinations, and synthesize complexity without necessarily conducting a full experiment or analysis. Or, we can approach the problem from the other end, starting with full complexity, and delete unimportant factors one by one. An alternative to these scenarios is to employ frameworks of intermediate complexity. The idea is to compare and contrast one or more levels of complexity and experiment through single or multiple additions and deletions to arrive at a functional map of causation. The systematic use of different entry points is a promising way to make important discoveries, and significantly advance our understanding of the interacting forces that drive coevolution. Over the past 15 years we have developed theory and conducted experiments to elucidate the roles of environment and biotic interactions in both antagonistic and mutualistic coevolutionary systems. We propose to build on these foundations with the goal of a general theoretical framework to reveal the relative roles played by exogenous environments and the interacting couple itself in coevolution between pathogens and their hosts. We are interested in discovering the driving mechanisms behind emergent patterns at three levels of resolution, and how these levels are interrelated and interact. First, we will consider how the severity or 'virulence' of disease is influenced by the coevolution of infectivity traits in the pathogen and resistance traits in the host. This is a topic of major importance in epidemiology and population biology, as well as the more applied area of disease management. Theoretical approaches have investigated how organism biology, population ecology, immune systems, and genetics act and interact to determine pathogen virulence. We are starting to appreciate how both host behavior and physiological condition influence virulence, and in particular that the structure of contact networks can be a pivotal mediator of pathogen evolution. We will aim to understand the less studied phenomenon of how environmental change, be it transitory or progressive, in impacting transmission networks and the quality of the host as a habitat for the pathogen, translates into changes in virulence. Second, we will relate virulence evolution in coevolving systems to community structure and the emergence of interactive networks between host and pathogen strains in simple two-species and complex multi-species communities. Much of our understanding of the coevolutionary process comes from population approaches: changes in the frequencies of interacting or non-interacting genotypes in pathogen and host. My group has recently contributed importantly to this research by showing how individual genotypes may establish and break links between one another, resulting in a dynamic network of specialist and generalist pathogens, and hosts of different vulnerabilities to the range of pathogens in the environment. What we need to know is how and why the structure of these â€œbipartite networksâ€ changes in simple and complex environments. Third, pathogens may multiply and spread via select types of host individual (so-called 'super-spreaders'). In some cases, this may result in severe epidemics followed by abrupt extinctions, but more generally super-spreading will lead to complex and possibly unpredictable epidemiological consequences at regional scales. A major, unresolved question is how the super-spreading phenomenon affects coevolutionary dynamics, and to what extent is the spread of disease primed by contingencies, such as structured or noisy environments. We need to know how coevolving networks are organized and collapse during and following epidemics; we also need to understand how certain virulent pathogen strains emerge and affect such events. Our ultimate goal is a coevolutionary synthesis that will explain pattern at units from genes to communities and for different temporal and spatial scales. The proposed work will assess to what extent the finesse and spectacular nature of adaptations in coevolving species are influenced by exogenous environments. These studies will have broader implications, since their key elementsâ€”individual traits, interaction networks and spatial structure--are properties of a variety of other complex systems. For instance, with appropriate modifications, this theory can be applied to human populations, including vaccination strategies, predicting the spatial spread of epidemics, and managing nosocomial diseases in hospitals. From a more social science and economics perspective our studies will have parallels with how cooperative exchanges are established and broken and how exploitation (analogous to virulence) emerges and evolves in different social environments.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), Institute of Evolutionary Sciences', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020294\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '446,780', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Thus a description of biological systems requires that we focus on particular aspects at the expense of neglecting details relating to non-focal aspects, particularly when the description relates to the formulation of a model to be used for quantitative analysis and prediction. Examples include epidemiological models used to understand processes driving the spread of disease and to evaluate control strategies such as vaccination, case isolation and quarantine. These models generally divide the population into various disease, demographic, and risk classes. They ascribe identical properties to all individuals in the same class, thereby ignoring important sources of variability among individuals such as host genetics, pathogen genetics, and the contact (or pairing) behavior of hosts. Some of these difficulties have inspired the formulation of so-called individual-based and network models. Even these models do not provide a proper treatment of processes that take place within individual hosts, such as evolution of drug-resistant pathogen strainsa problem that is now seriously affecting our ability to control AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. A full analysis of drug resistance in epidemics at a minimum requires the merging of models of within-host pathogen-strain dynamics and among host disease dynamics. Within-host disease models typically consider different time and spatial scales from epidemic models. Most importantly the two types of models represent descriptions of biological systems at different hierarchical levels of organization. One of the most important challenges today in the general area of biological systems analysis is how to formulate models at consecutive levels of organization in a way that facilitates merging level of analysis. In this proposal, I develop approaches to modeling consecutive levels of biological systems in ways that facilitates the analysis of the affects of processes at one level on processes and states at the other level. My current research program includes several different problems that require merging two levels of analysis in biological systems. Questions that my collaborators and I propose to address include: Problems 1, 3, 4, and 6 are currently funded in the context of specific system studies. The funding provided under this grant will support the development of general methods that apply to problems requiring the formulation of models at two consecutive levels of description: a lower constitutive level and an upper integrative level. These models are formulated in terms of processes acting at each level and then linked across levels. If the time constants of the constitutive level are much faster than the integrative level then the integrative level dynamics can be analyzed by assuming the constitutive level is either at an equilibrium or is at some time average value. For systems where the disparity of time constants is not that great, I propose linearizing the constitutive system around its equilibrium or average value and exploring the degree to which this approximation allows results to be obtained at the integrative system level. I also propose extending to the types of two-layer models described above generalized methods of sensitivity analysis that have been developed in biochemical systems theory under the rubric of Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) and its extension to Hierarchical Control Analysis. In the guise of Trophic Control Analysis, my collaborators and I have recently modified the theory to apply to trophic chains in ecology, but it remains for a control analysis theory to be formulated for linked constitutive-integrative level systems models. This theory should yield theorems stated in the form of matrix relationships that can be used to solve for the relative effects of processes at one level of description on processes and values of variables at another level of description for the biological system at hand. With such theorems in hand, we hope to gain new insights into all six questions enumerated above, and pave the way for others to do the same in systems across the whole spectrum of biology, from biochemistry and genetics, through physiology and ecology, to evolutionary population biology.

This is an issue of pressing societal importance, given that approximately 5-10% of school-aged children lack developmentally appropriate language skills. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that infants are remarkably skilled at laboratory language learning tasks, including tracking myriad statistical properties of linguistic input. However, all of this work involves off-line measures of learning, in which infants are first exposed to some set of stimuli (often from an artificial miniature language), and subsequently tested on discrimination of familiar versus novel patterns. This essay describes new thinking that has the potential to significantly extend the empirical and theoretical reach of infant language research by focusing on the role of on-line as a mechanism of language processing and learning. There are several sources of indirect evidence to suggest that prediction may play a role in infant language learning. However, this hypothesis has not been experimentally tractable given the standard methods in infant language research. Motivated by the theoretical and practical importance of understanding how infants learn language, we have recently developed new methods that will allow us to directly investigate the prediction hypothesis. We propose to interrogate infant language processing and learning using measures of eye-gaze, focusing on the critically important question of how infants learn syntax. On-line measures of infants’ predictions will be used to test important theoretical questions concerning the degree to which statistical regularities are actually employed during online processing. In addition, these methods afford the opportunity to test an assumption of computational models of learning in actual infant learners. One of the key insights of modern computational neuroscience is that if a learner at time-step predicts what will occur in the input at time-step , discrepancies between the predicted input and the actual input provide a learning signal. Can infants also detect discrepancies between their predictions and actual language input in real time, as simulated in these models? If so, predictions could facilitate learning via covert self-correction. The prediction framework also motivates tests of theoretical claims concerning domain-specificity and critical periods, can be applied to both typically and atypically developing infants, and will be integrated with subsequent studies concerning the neural bases of infant learning.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Wisconsin - Madison', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020147\\n', 'year': '2007', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Reading Chinese is a different experience from reading English. As an alphabetic system, English represents the basic sounds (phonemes) of the spoken language in its letters, and arranges these letters from left-to-right, each roughly representing a sound in sequence. Chinese, by contrast, does not represent these basic sounds. Instead a character represents the entire spoken syllable while it also corresponds to a meaningful word, in most cases. And the square shape of the character presents another contrast with the linear ordering of alphabetic letters. Our project combines two research programs, one that has focused on cognitive studies of reading in Chinese and English with one that has focused on the functional neuroanatomy of word reading, as studied with English. The methods of the project are primarily the application of neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to three populations of adult readers: Monolingual speakers of English; native Chinese speakers who speak English as a second language; and English speakers who are learning as adults to speak and read Chinese. The project aims to make focused comparisons among these groups in simple reading tasks to address basic questions about how the brain carries out word reading. Neuroimaging research in English word reading has produced interesting results with some emerging consensus on brain regions that support reading. One particular result remains uncertain: The existence of a \"visual word form\" area in left posterior cortex (near the occipital-temporal boundary) that responds only to strings of letters that are words or a lot like words (pronounceable nonwords such as \"klag\"). Because of the different organization of the Chinese system, comparing Chinese reading and English reading may lead to clearer understanding of this word form area--whether its location and function are universal or dependent on experience with particular writing systems, for example. The first set of experiments in our project will provide a series of critical comparisons concerning the word form area. Subjects from the three language background groups will view Chinese and English graphic stimuli that vary in their formal properties, especially the extent to which they are word-like-letter strings, pseudowords (pronounceable nonwords), and real words in English; false characters (real strokes but not real radicals), pseudocharacters (real radicals but in illegal positions), and real characters in Chinese. Of special interest is whether a word form area is found in Chinese that is specifically sensitive to both real characters and pseudocharacters, analogous to English or sensitive selectively to real characters only. The latter outcome would suggest that Chinese characters are perceived more globally rather than compositionally as seems to be case in English. Equally interesting is whether learners of Chinese show a pattern more similar to English or to Chinese natives. Our learners will be in their first and second years of college level Chinese. We predict that they will be insensitive to the difference between real characters and pseudocharacters, because their experience has not been sufficient to support such a distinction. The monolingual English group should not differentiate any of these Chinese stimuli--all should appear as potential members of the category of Chinese characters. As for the Chinese language group, we are interested especially in whether their word form area for English and Chinese overlap, or whether they have developed two nonoverlapping systems. Second, is their English word form area sensitive to the same contrasts as English speakers or does it include only actual words? More generally, we also ask whether, when one learns a new system, it is separated in its functional neuroanatomy from the native language system. Beyond the basic comparisons across these groups in perceiving word-like stimuli are studies that provide more information about the perception of words and other studies that examine other parts of the brain network that responds to printed words. In the first category are studies that will compare face perception, which also may be carried out within specialized areas within the object recognition system, with word perception. And, because written Chinese has pictographic origins-although very little pictographic content in its current inventory of characters-it is interesting to ask whether those characters that are more picture-like are processed by the same mechanisms that process abstract characters, for which there is no hint of pictographic content. In the second category, studies that examine other parts of the brain's word processing network, are studies that examine phonological processes, the pronunciation component of words. These processes are pervasive in reading, even when reading is silent and directed at meaning, and even when the writing system seems designed to allow by-passing pronunciation, as Chinese does. In these studies, we ask about the role of expertise, both reading skill within one's native language and experience in a second language. In recent work with surface electrical recordings, we have found evidence that American students learning Chinese show differential brain responses to characters they have experience frequently in their curriculum compared with characters they have experience less frequently. In this project we want to test the hypothesis that this frequency effect reflects brain processes in both the visual form area and areas in left temporal-parietal and left frontal regions that support phonological processes. On one account, the left frontal region is associated with more effortful phonological decoding (of the kind an adult might do for an unfamiliar word) whereas the temporal-parietal area is associated with more automatic word-level phonology. We want to test the hypothesis that the learners of Chinese, in a pronunciation task, show activation in the frontal area for less familiar characters with activation in temporal-parietal areas emerging for frequently experienced areas. Another approach to phonology will take advantage of the fact that Chinese children are taught reading initially through pin-yin, an alphabetic system using letters of the western (Roman) alphabet. As adults, although theses readers experience little pin yin, they are able to read it. For an Englishspeaking subject, a pin yin word can be an English nonword. For example, would a Chinese word (minus tone) for a Chinese reader, but a nonword for an English reader. If Chinese adults see a word like written in pin yin, will they process it in the same way they would an English nonword, or more like a Chinese character? We expect the monolingual English reader to process it like a nonword. In another use of pin yin, we will examine whether learners of Chinese come to treat English nonwords as more regular in pronunciation. The inconsistencies of English spelling allow a nonword like \"hint\" to be pronounced in a \"regular\" way (as in hint, lint, and tint) or in an exception way (pint). Given a list of nonwords like \"bint,\" subjects can produce mixes of pronunciation (regular vs exception). Our interest is in what happens after they take the course in Chinese, which begins with heavy use of pin yin, which is completely consistent or regular in its mapping. It is possible that their approach to English word reading, and English nonword reading, will be modified by a sustained experience with a completely regular system. In addressing these questions we rely on behavioral measures (pronunciations of words and nonwords) with some additional neuroimaging work targeted for both left temporal-parietal and left frontal regions. Although our main focus will be on differences in expertise across systems, we will also be testing readers of English who differ in reading skill. It would be of great interest to discover that skill differences within English, which we can asses with our behavioral measures as differences in literacy experiences that produce differential knowledge of word form and meaning, are similar to the kinds of differences that arise in language expertise. In simple form, the question is whether English readers learning Chinese and monolingual readers of English show similar brain correlates of reading performance.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Pittsburgh', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002083\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '446,796', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Lester Brown, in his essay \" \" (Brown et al., 1996), illustrates how the last few decades have seen an explosion of human activity. For example, Brown notes that between 1950 and 1995: o o o o These changes in human population and activity, which occurred in only forty-five years, completely outpaced the actions of all previous human generations put together. We can recognize the impact of Homo sapiens throughout the global environment, ranging from fundamental changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere to the wholesale modification of Earth's land cover. For example, approximately 18 million km2 (an area roughly the size of South America) is currently in some form of cultivation. Furthermore, anthropogenic nitrogen sources into the environment (from fertilizers and atmospheric pollutants) now exceed all natural sources, and atmospheric C02 concentrations have risen (as a result of energy- and land-use) by roughly one-third since the Industrial Revolution. Ironically, just as our collective activities are changing climatic and environmental processes across the globe, humanity has become increasingly dependent on the goods and services provided by the environment. Increases in our population and standard of living have driven rapidly accelerating rates of food and freshwater consumption, timber harvesting, and energy use. For example, Vitousek et al. (1997) reported that nearly one-third to one-half of global ecosystem production is now co-opted by human activity. Furthermore, Postel et al. (1996) estimated that roughly half of the world's available freshwater supply is now being used by humanity. Finally, Costanza et al. (1997) estimated that the goods and services provided by the natural environment have the equivalent economic value of between US$16-54 trillion per year, compared to the global gross domestic product of roughly US$18 trillion per year. The natural question arises: UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES My research team aims to answer this question, by improving our understanding the changing nature of the world's ecosystems and watersheds, and how they interact with the atmosphere and oceans. In particular, much of my research focuses on building and testing computer models of the Earth's ecosystems, watersheds and climate. Using computer models, we can explore how ecological, climatic, and hydrological processes interact to support the rich diversity of life found on this planet. My work has three major foci: o Understanding Terrestrial Ecosystems - From the Field to the Globe. The Earth's terrestrial ecosystems are critically important to the welfare of humankind. Food, fiber, fresh water, medicines, and forest products are all derived from our terrestrial ecosystems. In addition, terrestrial ecosystems play a central role in regulating the biogeochemical and climate systems of this planet. To better understand ecological processes, and to evaluate their response to human activity, my research team is developing IBIS (Integrated Biosphere Simulator) - a new comprehensive computer model of the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. We are currently using the model to study how ecosystems respond to changes in land use and climate. We continue to test the IBIS model against field measurements collected from ecosystems around the world. o Understanding Freshwater Systems - Rivers, Lakes and Wetlands. The Earth's freshwater systems, as sources of potable water, hydroelectric power and food, are of great importance to human society. Our research team is focused on the behavior of whole watersheds - including lakes, wetlands, rivers and groundwater systems. In particular, we are interested in how land use and variations in climate can affect the availability and quality of fresh water resources. In order to help answer these questions, we are developing new computer modeling tools to examine the impact of human activities on freshwater supplies across the globe. Recent efforts have been focused on the HYDRA (HYDrological Routing Algorithm) model, which simulates the flow of water through groundwater systems, rivers, lakes and wetlands. We are currently working to understand the effects of management practices, artificial structures, and land use changes on the water cycle. We continue to improve the modeling tools, and test them against field data and satellite measurements. o Linkages Between Climate and Ecosystems. Looking across the globe, we see that patterns of temperature and rainfall limit the range of many plant and animal species. In fact, we see strong geographic associations between climate and ecosystems, ranging from the tropical rainforests, through the subtropical deserts and temperate forests, all the way to the northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra. But changes in vegetation cover can also affect the physical properties of the land surface and how it interacts with the atmosphere. Removing the forest cover over a large area, for example, reduces the amount of water evaporated back into the atmosphere, leaving less water and energy available to fuel weather systems. Our research team is building new computer models that fully link the two-way relationships between climate and ecosystems. In particular, we have incorporated our IBIS terrestrial ecosystem model directly within global climate models of the atmosphere and ocean. We have used these \"coupled\" models to examine how changes in ecosystems could affect the future climate of our planet. For example, shifting patterns of global vegetation cover, caused by future greenhouse warming, might induce large feedbacks on the climate system. Our initial results suggest that changes in vegetation could magnify the effects of global warming, especially in high northern latitudes. USING MODELS TO EXPLORE THE FUTURE Computer modeling tools allow us to explore the complex behavior of global environmental systems, and examine how they may respond to human activity. But these models are not perfect \" \", capable of foretelling the future in a perfectly accurate way. Rather they are \" \", where we can test hypotheses about nature, and explore the consequences of different decisions. Using these \" \", we can peer beyond our own time and our own limited experience. They can help chart a path toward the future, and tell us something about the landscape ahead. But we may still be surprised when we arrive at our destination. Perhaps the best use of the models is to help us understand the variety of possible futures we may face - rather than betting everything on any one particular forecast. Are there uncertainties ahead? Are there are abrupt cliffs lurking out there, just waiting to surprise us with a sudden drop? Are there \" \", where we cannot undo environmental damages once they occur? Where are these critical decision-making points? In our research, we use global environmental models in this exploratory mode. We aim to learn more about the behavior of environmental systems, so that we may better understand the consequences of the many possible future paths we may take. For example: o Global modeling tools can be used to examine how \" \" environmental systems are. That is, how do they respond to change? In a predictable \" \" fashion, by following existing trends? Or a highly \" \" way, which can show sudden and sometimes unpredictable changes? o Computer models also help us see potential \" \" or \" \" in our natural resources. For example, some environmental systems appear to be stable, until they reach a critical threshold where they will show a sudden, large response to human activity. Without understanding where the thresholds are in our natural resource systems, we may be in for unpleasant surprises. o Finally, global environmental models can show us \" \", where future environmental changes could be highly disruptive. As an example, we can consider the response of crops to global warming: are there \"hot spots\", where crops are much more sensitive to changes in rainfall and temperature? Using computer models to detect the \"hot spots\" of potential change in our ecosystems and freshwater resources helps us focus our attention to critical geographic regions, where scientific monitoring and discussions of policy options must be undertaken in earnest. A FINAL COMMENT We are now facing critical environmental problems that will affect the quality of human life for decades and centuries to come. Solving these problems, in many cases, will require interdisciplinary research to help us understand how the Earth's complex environmental systems function and respond to human activity. Understanding the complex behavior of environmental systems, seen through the lens of a computer model, may help us chart a path towards a more environmentally secure future. But we also must integrate these research results more completely into decision-making and public policy, with the ultimate goat of managing our planet's natural resources - the air, freshwater, land and biological diversity upon which all life depends - sustainably into the future.

Connections between neurons are strengthened or weakened as we learn each new skill and acquire each new memory. Such circuitry changes, called 'brain plasticity', serve to optimize the brain's function to meet each individual's needs. If I decide one day I want to get better at tap dancing, wine tasting, or identifying bird calls, my brain is happy to oblige and rewire its circuits to make these skills possible. Practice makes perfect because practice triggers plasticity. The observation that people can get ten times better at most simple tasks with a few weeks of practice has lead some to wrongly conclude that we use only ten percent of our brains. In fact, the brain allocates its computational resources with great efficiency. Brain plasticity allows neural networks to accomplish difficult tasks that evolution never selected for, including freeway driving, Braille reading, and calculus. The nervous system, like the immune system, evolved to solve undefined problems and adapt to changing environments. Even the brain's remarkable ability to adapt does have limits, however. Brain damage can cause pain, paralysis, blindness, and loss of language depending an the regions of the brain that are affected. Plasticity helps restore some function by rewiring damaged circuits, but is often insufficient for full recovery, even after months of rehabilitation. Despite advances in neurosurgery, there is presently no way to directly rewire the brain. While physicians can treat many of the symptoms of brain damage, there is little they can do to stimulate recovery. In this way treatment far neurological disease is very much lice treatment for infection and cancer was a century ago. Recent research offers new hope for millions of stroke patients struggling to regain lost independence. It may one day be possible to rebuild damaged circuits and restore lost function by guiding plasticity in much the same way that doctors now routinely manipulate the immune system. We know from studies of normal learning that plasticity depends on repetition and attention. If I intently practice bird call identification, for example, the part of my brain that responds to these sounds would increase, malting it easier to distinguish the subtle differences between them. However, if I simply heard the sounds over and over without focusing on them, there would be no change in my brain and I would learn nothing. Focused attention stimulates release of neurotransmitters that encourage plasticity and learning. Without this mechanism to regulate plasticity our neurons would try to learn every detail about common, but useless stimuli like air conditioner sounds and the textures of our clothes. During the period after brain damage decreases levels of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine, dopamine, and norepinephrine are decreased, limiting the brain's rewiring potential. Drugs that increase release of these transmitters don't help much because they tend to stimulate non-specific plasticity. However, if one could direct the form of plasticity stimulated by these drugs, it might be possible to control rewiring and restore lost function. I have recently demonstrated that it is possible to precisely manipulate plasticity in animals by controlling neurotransmitter release and sensory experience. Using electrical stimulation of one of the brain's learning centers, I was able to alter both the brain's wiring and processing speed. My next goals are to develop a method to control plasticity by combining drug therapy with sensory stimulation and to test its effectiveness in restoring functions lost to brain damage. Preliminary evidence indicates that combining speech and physical therapy with pharmacological stimulation can significantly improve recovery from stroke. As these techniques are refined, they may make complete recovery from stroke a realistic goal. The potential to manipulate plasticity in humans would also be beneficial for patients suffering from other neurological disorders. Many scientists believe that epilepsy, focal dystonia, tinnitus, and chronic pain result from pathological forms of plasticity. While current treatments attempt to alleviate the symptoms of these conditions, neurorehabilitation could be used to reverse the bad wiring that causes them. It may even be possible to use therapeutic plasticity as a treatment for psychiatric disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, drug addiction, obsessive?compulsive disorder, and phobia. The proposed experiments will provide a solid experimental Foundation for further development of neurorehabilitation to minimize side effects and optimize patient recovery. Although far from proven, neurorehabilitation has the potential to transform the treatment of brain disease in the same way that antibiotics and chemotherapy have changed the treatment of infection and cancer.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002080\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '446,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

By and large they are people just like you. How do they do it? They ask themselves a question and look for the answer. Why do they do it? They do it because they are lucky enough to be able to do something they enjoy. Like you and me, they are fallible, like you and me they can't possibly know everything and like you and me they have bad days. Perhaps it would be fair to say that the least scientific thing about science is the scientists themselves. You may be right in saying so if you are talking about experimental rigor. The recent human genome mapping programme has shown us all just how well machines do it. They have no vested interest in the results, they work tirelessly, there are no personality clashes or disagreements. BUT, machines just don't do it, that is, they don't conceptualise, hypothesise, rationalise, or play devils advocate. So, although we are surrounded by the products of science in our everyday lives, there is a whole industry of idea-makers who provide the fundamental basis of scientific thought, without them there just isn't any science. Although both Francis Crick and James Watson had plenty of hi-tech machinery at hand when they discovered the DNA double helix it wasn't the machinery that discovered it. It was their questioning, their enthusiasm, their dexterity and their determination. Like most discoveries, the overall implications of their accomplishment have only revealed with the passing of time. Genetically altered pigs used to grow hearts for human transplant, who could have thought it a reality 30 years ago? Only a far-sighted few would have even imagined it possible. Accepting that the human element is the fundamental ingredient in science, how do we do it? A good question, a very good question, the problem is the answer: we have no idea. It is this human quality of cognition, perception, mentation, call it what you like, that leads us to question how we do it. The question is not a new one, it has been in the minds of some of the greatest minds. Plato, Aristotle, Hypocretes, Einstein, Freud, Cajal and Crick, to mention but just a few, have all dabbled with this conundrum. It is often claimed that it is a great irony that the hidden capabilities of the human mind lead us to question what it is and how it works, but don't let us find the answers. Nonsense I say, sweeping aside the mystique, the real reason we know so little about the mind is that so little has been done to understand its complexity. When all is said and done, a lot has been said and little done. The lack of systematic investigation, combined with erroneous dogma, politics and contemporary thinking are equally culpable. Strong words, heresy for a scientist you may say. Perhaps you are right, buts let's look at how such things may happen. One example that comes to mind is that of stomach ulcers. We all know that they are caused by stress. That has been the standard response by physicians for many decades, they must have been correct, they are some of the best-educated people in society. They were wrong, year after year the myth was perpetuated by their lecturers at university. As young students they realised they must state the same \"truth\" back to their lecturers if they chose to pass the subject. They, unbeknownst to them, were being indoctrinated with dogma. Without knowing it the standard response to their patients who presented with stomach ulcers was that its stress related and that the best thing to do is to take a holiday. Fortunately a young Australian medical practicioner was prepared to challenge this dogma. His systematic investigations into stomache ulcers revealed to him that a particular type of bacteria may be responsible. Hedicobacter pylori. He was ridiculed, can't be a bacterium because when the patient takes broad-spectrum antibiotics they don't get cured. Fortunately, his tenacity led him to show that it is particularly virulent bacteria resistant to just one type of penicillin but a combined prescription could solve the problem. So what? Well this journey took Dr Foster more than 10 years, international ridicule by his colleagues and rejection from funding agencies. Out of pure desperation he infected himself with the bacteria, allowed himself to get seriously ill and then cured himself to make people listen. What I'm trying to say is that those same abilities that empower us to conceptualise great things, cognition, perception, mentation, can also serve as our own worst enemies. We are indeed complex creatures. When studying why we are so complex, or more specifically, how we are capable of thinking, we are faced with a similar anecdote. Prof Cajal, after a lifetime of dedicated investigations of the brains many different types of animals concluded that our cognitive abilities are the result of the complexity of the circuits in our brain. Obviously you might say. Well, another scientist of considerable stature, Prof Eccles, is of the opinion that the mammalian brain is built of the same basic repeated circuit, a view that is widely held by contemporary neuroscientists. Who do we believe? Both were awarded the nobel prize for their contributions to science. The latter viewpoint is very convenient because it means you can study any brain area and then you know what happens in the brain. Many scientisits have been using this concept for a long time to argue for funding: if we study the brain of a rat we know what will happen in humans. It has to be said that there is some merit in the argument, but there is also a lot of politics. This debate has now become a focal point of neuroscience. This years nobel laureate for physiology and medicine, Prof Kandel, has challenged the neuroscience community by declaring this area of research as the most formidable challenge facing researchers over the next decade. This is where I humbly enter the story. My own experiments support the contentions of Prof Cajal. The basic building block of the cortex, the pyramidal cell, shows remarkable phenotypic variation in the cortex of man, and other species. These cells in our prefrontal cortex, the site generally believed to initiate/modulate our thought processes, appear to be them most complex in our brains. Furthermore, pyramidal cells in our prefrontal cortex are much more complex than those of other primates studied so far. My initial results also show dramatic differences in the evolution of prefrontal cortex in New World primates of the Americas as compared to other primates. How does this impact on you and I? The repercussions are not necessarily immediately obvious. To the non-specialist this may seem to be purely academic. However, I am now using these same methodologies and systematic approach to study dementia associated with Down syndrome, Huntingtons disease and epilepsy. I also hope to extend my findings to the study of the brain's recuperative ability following peripheral injury such as loss of limb, or retinal detachment as well as stroke. The findings also have clear repercussions for the study of age-related illness such as Alzheimer's disease and failing memory. I am more enthusiastic about the possibilities with every day that passes.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Queensland', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002081\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '476,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

We seek help, share information, and maintain social bonds through interpersonal, often face-to-face, communication. Real world communication is rich, nuanced, and impacted moment-by-moment by subtle linguistic and nonlinguistic cues. Yet, our research has tended to carve communication at its joints. Researchers investigating speech perception, voice recognition, face recognition, speech production, and gesture have engaged in largely parallel progress with surprisingly little cross-talk and virtually no attempts to build ‘universal’ approaches to human communication. Moreover, most research has adhered to carefully controlled laboratory studies, the very nature of which influences the theoretical constructs we identify as significant, the questions we pursue, and the answers we can discover. The time is right to develop new tools and approaches to break human communication research out of the laboratory and pursue it in real world contexts. The wide and ever-growing array of wearable sensors available to track behavior (accelerometers, GPS, heart rate, motion, portable neuroimaging, etc.) offers the potential to collect highly detailed, time-resolved records of multiple facets of real-world behavior. At the same time, powerful new computational approaches are being developed for automatic speech recognition, object/event recognition, behavior recognition, and video/image analysis that can monitor detailed sensor data in real-time, and categorize it according to the emotional valence of speech, the engagement of a listener, the amusement of a conversation partner, or a host of other dimensions. As colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, we see a unique opportunity to blend our cognitive science and computer science research programs to break new empirical and analytical ground in understanding human communication in the wild. Our central hypothesis is that understanding real-world communication will require us to direct new research focus to engagement. Face-to-face communication is more than an exchange of continuous speech input modestly supported by a view of the talker. We aim to understand dynamic signals (under both conscious and unconscious control) that meet communicative demands, how we pick up on (or miss) these signals, and the impact of these signals on what gets communicated. In this two-year project, we will study the ultimate communication innovators – teenage girls – who, across hundreds of years, have been documented to be on the leading edge of communication change and thus provide an excellent initial testing ground. We take the approach of collecting acoustic, video, and eye gaze data via sensor-embedded glasses across a freely flowing coffee shop conversation between familiar pairs of teens, and the same teens shuffled so that the pairs are strangers. We will extract and quantify signals such as laughing, amount of time to react and silences, gaze aversion and engagement, convergence of speech, and face emotions beyond laughter using machine learning algorithms, and then calculate an engagement value from these behavioral metrics. This rich dataset, with an experimental manipulation across dyad familiarity, will allow us to rigorously test the feasibility of these (and other) real-world indices of communication and engagement.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3997', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Even young infants actively sample and select aspects of their environment by moving their eyes, and later by reaching towards people and objects and eventually locomoting. Thus, young children actively construct their visual datasets for learning. But many children (especially those with neurodevelopmental disorders) experience pervasive perturbations in the motor system. Here we ask: how might motor difficulties constrain the everyday visual experiences of young children? The literature is replete with assumptions (including our own!) that motor difficulties limit or bias the child’s everyday experiences, cascading on later development. Yet, if research with typically developing children has taught us anything, it is to not rely on our assumptions of how their everyday experiences look as they are not easily predictable by adult intuition. For example, it is only when we step into the shoes of typically developing children that we realise that scenes which seem busy and confusing from an adult perspective may in fact look quite orderly to typically developing children due to the way their motor actions constrain their visual experiences. This highlights why it is so important to capture the visual experiences of children with motor difficulties. To advance our knowledge and understanding, we need to shift away from static lab-based paradigms and standardised tests which dominate the field of neurodevelopmental disorders and step into the shoes of the child with motor difficulties. Here we plan to utilise head-mounted cameras in an accelerated longitudinal design during the first five years of life in a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with profound motor difficulties – Down syndrome. We will focus on three key aims: (1) Investigate whether motor experience predicts everyday visual experiences in children with Down syndrome and in typically developing children; (2) Examine the role of social context in these visual experiences; (3) Leverage machine learning with this rich dataset to create open-source annotation tools to facilitate future research. We believe that understanding the characteristics and timing of visual experiences of children with motor difficulties will transform our mechanistic understanding of development and enable us to build interventions with long lasting effects. It will also facilitate the development of intervention outcome measures that draw on moment-by-moment everyday data. This project is a critical first step towards these goals. In terms of immediate community impact, our findings, as well as the individual recordings from the head-mounted cameras, will enable parents and practitioners to step into the shoes of children with motor difficulties. This will transform their understanding of how to scaffold the child’s ability to construct robust developmentally appropriate visual datasets, ultimately improving their everyday learning opportunities.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Cardiff University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2022-3711', 'year': '2022', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Was that my friend’s face I just saw in the crowd? Due to ambiguity and noise, such decisions are fundamentally probabilistic and therefore complex. Nonetheless, we make them with remarkable ease and efficiency. This is surprising, given that their combinatorial nature makes following optimal strategies for such decisions intractable. For example, ideally, we would need to consider millions to billions of possible odor combinations just to decide which small number of a large repertoire of possible odors are likely present at breakfast. Similar combinatorial growth of possibilities plagues almost all every-day perceptual choices. This makes the computations underlying such ideal decisions fundamentally unmanageable, such that they need to be approximated. The general question I want to address is which types of approximations our nervous system uses. An important component of perceptual choices is to accumulate evidence across multiple sources and over time, however brief. By now a large body of work by myself and other has demonstrated that humans and other animals accumulate such evidence in various situations in a seemingly near-optimal manner. Given that the underlying computations ought to be intractable, how is such near-optimal performance possible? The first reason is that in the tested circumstances, the tasks didn’t yet reach the level of complexity that made them intractable. The second reason is that, usually, the perceptual evidence was not well controlled, such that sub-optimal computations could be mistaken for less evidence provided to the decision maker. Once we controlled for this confound it became apparent that approximate computations are already at play for such tasks. These approximations might thus be general properties of our decision-making apparatus. Hence, determining their nature provides first steps towards identifying how our nervous system deals with intractable computations in general. My research program will focus on the following questions. 1) How much do approximate computations contribute to overall information loss in decision-making? 2) What is the nature of these approximations? 3) To which degree can they be motivated by computational and neurobiological constraints? These questions will be addressed from a theoretical perspective at the level of information coding in neural populations, and in collaboration with others through experiments with humans and animals. In contrast to identifying simply decision-making heuristics from bottom-up, the approach uses optimal, but possibly intractable strategies as a top-down starting point for approximations, with the potential to generalize beyond the specifics of the considered tasks. Thus, the research program would not only give us insight about the algorithms underlying particular decisions based on perceptual evidence, but might additionally yield approximation motives that the nervous system uses in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Harvard Medical School', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020462\\n', 'year': '2016', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In adult age especially, this can become an obstacle toward integration and employment. The interest in learning during adulthood has brought neuroscience in the last decade to reconsider the common belief of a rigid brain structure in adult life. The cerebral cortex displays local changes in volume and thickness: brain structures active during training expand while learning and return to baseline afterwards. The transient expansion is thought to reflect “work in progress” within brain regions involved in learning, meant to integrate new skills in existing neural circuitries, via strengthening and/or selecting local neuronal connections. The main hypothesis of this project is that the “work in progress” may be repurposed to benefit other functions, as long as they rely on the activity of the same brain territories. To use an allegory, imagine the renovation of a building (brain area), starting after the request of ameliorations from some of the residents (trained function). This becomes the occasion for other tenants (other functions) to see realized also their own wish for improvements. All those living in the same building will benefit from the renovation, provided that everybody has posed their requests during the “work in progress”. Out of the allegory, living in the same building means neural overlap and computational commonalities of functions in the brain. The case of motor and linguistic systems represents, from this perspective, a unique opportunity. State-of-the-art research documented neural overlap and functional interactions of motor and linguistic systems. We have evidenced that tool use and syntactic processes in one’s own language share activity in the basal ganglia, whose patterns display representational similarity. This supports the existence of a supramodal syntactic function subserving both motor system and language. Learning transfer between the two abilities arises: shortly training one function enhances performance in the other, when tested immediately after. This posits solid bases for a crucial step forward, gravid of important consequences and applications: testing the ground-breaking hypothesis that we can leverage brain changes induced by long-term tool use learning to boost new language learning. We propose a longitudinal approach, privileging data acquisition in real world context during a prolonged period of time, without sacrificing rigorous behavioral and neuroimaging measurements. We developed an app for language learning, allowing for data collection at home during several weeks, at a chosen moment of the day, with frequency and duration established by the experimenter. Similarly, for motor learning videos will be collected during home sessions of tool use training. By coupling those home assessments with weekly neuroimaging acquisitions with magnetic resonance, we will study brain changes, and their relationship with behavior, during progress in motor and linguistic performance. The project will test the mechanistic hypothesis that cross-domain transfer effects occur between tool use and language along the temporal dynamic of brain plasticity and the results can dramatically impact the strategies of language learning during the entire life-span.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (INSERM)', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2021-3101', 'year': '2021', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

One retrieves the information then returns it, unchanged, to its holding place when finished. Research,  however, suggests retrieval plays a much more active role in memory formation; namely that retrieving  information at Time 1 facilitates retrieval of the same information at Time 2, a phenomenon dubbed the  retrieval practice effect. This line of research is one that is currently receiving a considerable amount of  attention from both theoretical researchers, who are trying to understand why retrieval practice is such  an effective strategy for creating a durable memory trace, as well as applied researchers, who are  interested in understanding how retrieval via testing can facilitate improved learning outcomes in an  educational context. My interest in this topic began a few years ago with a simple question: what is the underlying  mechanism? While there was an intense amount of interest in the topic, on the whole, there was very  little research aimed at identifying a mechanism that could explain the basic effect. In a recent article I  laid out one of the first accounts helping to address this gap by drawing associations to other, better-understood memory phenomena. My studies showed that retrieving information at Time 1 strengthens  certain kinds of associations at the cost of others. The likelihood of observing improved retrieval at Time  2 is critically dependent upon the degree to which those previously-enhanced associations are  leveraged. If one structures the retrieval at Time 2 to be reliant upon different types of associations than  those made at Time 1, and interesting phenomenon occurs: memory performance actually decreases.  That is, retrieval at Time 1 actually disrupts retrieval of the same information at Time 2. Though this was an important step in helping to develop a theoretical framework, the finding generates  important applied questions as well. Namely, if there are particular laboratory conditions under which  retrieval at Time 1 disrupts retrieval at Time 2, are there commensurate educational conditions? If so,  this would imply that there are circumstances under which testing is an ineffective a (and possibly  detrimental) learning tool. Such findings would argue for significant changes to our current educational  policy. With support from the James S. McDonnell foundation, I hope to further explore both of these  questions. On the theoretical end of the spectrum, although I view this study as an important step in  specifying a mechanism for the retrieval practice effect, it’s still just that—a step. There is still considerable work to be done to fully flesh out the theoretical framework underlying the effect. On the applied end, it’s critically important to determine whether these laboratory-born disruptions carry over to more ecologically valid educational contexts. Educators who pride themselves on evidence-based practice have long touted the benefits of testing, but I would argue there are potentially important limiting conditions that have yet to be fully explored.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Knox College', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020429', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

What kind of considerations shape our moral assessment of others? Is common sense moral thinking unified in one moral system? These questions are at the heart of the study of moral cognition. Answers to them shed light on the scope of moral thinking, the nature of moral disagreement, and the socio-cultural factors that mediate our relationship with morality. To that end, cognitive scientists have begun looking at the cognitive and emotional mechanisms underlying moral judgment. Despite its importance, research on moral judgment has been limited in significant ways. First, for more than half a century, moral judgment has been studied through the lens of sacrificial dilemmas (e.g., Trolley Dilemmas). These are situations where an individual is faced with at least two options, each involving the violation of a moral norm. Unfortunately, these dilemmas are somewhat artificial and represent, at best, a small corner of everyday morality. It is, therefore, problematic to make general statements about real-life moral judgment on the basis of them. Research on moral judgment has also been limited with respect to the populations studied. There are currently various initiatives to study moral judgment outside the industrialized Anglo-European world. But, because the materials and situations being tested were originally designed with abstract philosophical theories in mind (e.g., Kantianism, Utilitarianism), cultural variation in moral judgment has been vastly underestimated. Lastly, studies of moral judgment typically ask participants to rate moral behavior along predefined scales (e.g., from good to bad, or appropriate to inappropriate). It is, however, plausible that everyday moral judgment has significantly more granularity and richness than these scales allow observing, which points to a further limitation in the studies done so far. Current instruments for measuring moral attitudes are, in short, not designed to observe these intricacies. Our project aims to revolutionize the study of moral judgment by pushing the boundaries of current research on the topic in three directions. The first is to develop new materials that describe more realistic non-dilemma scenarios. For this, we plan to construct scenarios from the ground up by studying the kind of moral situations that people in different contexts report when asked about common episodes of moral assessment. The second is to widen the socio-cultural characteristics of the populations studied. This requires reaching out to communities that cannot be accessed by conventional methods, such as laboratory or online testing. Finally, we seek to adopt a variety of methodologies (experience sampling, behavioral studies, linguistic analysis) that will better allow for the expression of idiosyncrasies in everyday moral judgment. Rather than imposing pre-defined categories of moral evaluation, we aim to establish and validate which categories individuals apply in their own contexts. In sum, our research aims to expand our understanding of moral cognition through the development of materials and methodologies that allow for a better appreciation of the complexity of moral life and the vast cultural and political differences that mediate our moral thinking.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Universidad de los Andes', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2020-1200', 'year': '2020', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

There is a key need for research in this area to combine the application of infant brain imaging methods with detailed observations of behavior in ecologically appropriate contexts. A growing movement in developmental science to develop methods for data collection outside the laboratory has gained momentum due to recent events related to COVID-19. The proposed research involves the development of methods for collecting and analyzing videos of infant grasping actions that are recorded by caregivers in the home setting using a mobile device. Employing a longitudinal design, we will combine data from these home assessments with data from a laboratory visit that employs electroencephalographic (EEG) methods to tap into novel measures of neural body representations as well as detailed multi-method analyses of infant behavior.  The proposed work focuses on developmental changes in skilled grasping that occur between 6 and 14 months of age, specifically changes in the way that the different fingers of the hand are involved in grasping objects.  We will analyze the changing patterns of finger involvement derived from the video data alongside an EEG measure that taps into neural representations of the digits of the hand and the relations among them. This innovative combination will allow a data-driven, multivariate investigation of the brain-body-behavior interface. In doing so, it will enable the researchers involved to work at new boundaries and thus extend their research in impactful ways. We will carry out an ecologically valid evaluation of grasping skills at home, utilizing video data collected by caregivers using a novel video app and analysis methods that will be developed specifically for this project. We will couple the longitudinal video data from the home setting with a detailed, multi-method quantification of grasping actions and EEG recording in the laboratory at 14 months of age. Guided by new advances in understanding the development of grasping in infancy as well as novel technological developments in video technology and mobile app development, we will relate differential changes in finger involvement in grasping between 6 and 14 months of age to the patterning of the infant somatosensory mismatch negativity (sMMN) response to tactile stimulation of pairs of digits. We will use multivariate analyses to examine the neural data alongside manual grasping skills as derived from video coding (including kinematics), standardized assessment, and parental report. The research team combines an investigator with a proven record of work using infant EEG to probe aspects of body representations (Peter Marshall) and a researcher with expertise in kinematic analyses and strong connections to developers of novel methods for the collection of video data outside the laboratory (Valentina Parma).  One product of this novel and potentially synergistic collaboration will be a new tool to collect and analyze behavior using video collected in home settings. Other key outcomes of the proposed project will come through an enhanced understanding of the dynamic developmental interface of brain, body, and behavior in human development.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Temple University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/2020-1209', 'year': '2020', 'amount': '250,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Despite such a belief, a significant number of our decisions and actions in visual environments depend exclusively on perceptual inferences derived from internalized representations of external information.  Put another way, many of our decisions and subsequent actions are the direct result of our brains making “guesses” based on “fabricated” information.  Remarkably, the brain’s strategy for deriving “meaning” from guesses based on fabrication is not only highly accurate, but is also extremely efficient.  That is, high levels of decision accuracy are achieved with visual information sampled within less time than it takes to blink your eyes.  Exactly how the brain accomplishes rapid perceptual inference remains elusive.  My research program is therefore focused on providing answers to this question through an understanding of how early low-level visual signals provide distinct codes for different visual environments, and how those codes contribute to the formation of rapid perceptual inference. The primary domain within which my research program explores rapid perceptual inference is visual scene categorization (e.g., identifying a scene at the basic or superordinate level).  Scene categorization makes an ideal vessel to explore rapid perceptual inference because: 1) it is exceedingly fast and efficient (i.e., it can be achieved after viewing a scene for as little as 1/100th of a second), 2) it is known to precede identification of the constituent objects of the scenes themselves, and 3) it is known to serve as the guiding framework for directing the deployment of overt attention.  Given the extreme efficiency of this categorization process, my collaborators and I have argued that it might be the internalized low-level structural attributes of scenes that serve to guide rapid categorization – an argument that has fueled an on-going interdisciplinary investigation within my lab over the last several years.  To date, that work has shown that different visual scenes possess distinct structural regularities that are actually used by humans during rapid scene categorization.  Further, visual evoked potential (VEP) work from my lab has shown that those same structural regularities are faithfully encoded at the earliest stage of cortical visual processing. In light of my ongoing research, I have built a working theory that it is the early visual cortical signals themselves that define the boundaries between scene categories.  That is, when rapid categorization is necessary, such signals may actually constitute the categorical representation itself (as opposed to neural processes signaling for their conceptual attributes).  With support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation, I plan to launch a broad-scale investigation that will test this notion through behavioral and neuroelectric paradigms.  I also plan to examine the relative contribution of early visual signals to other domains involving rapid comprehension and decision-making.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Colgate University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020430\\n', 'year': '2015', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Whether we think about what is right and wrong, what one ought to do or must not do, what is fair and unfair; whether we reason about the dilemmas of our everyday life or evaluate the actions of others; whether we enforce moral norms by arguments, sanctions, or education – we engage in moral considerations that are in their extent unique to humans. Indeed, no human society could exist without moral rules that regulate our behavior. And societal change is often related to a change in moral views. How and when do we develop moral norms? Although there is ample evidence that moral norms are acquired early in life, potentially supported by evolutionary roots, the psychological basis of the emergence and early ontogeny of morality is still poorly understood. My long-term research goal is to understand and develop a comprehensive theoretical account of how morality and moral concerns emerge during early ontogeny. A key focus of this account will be to identify the biological foundations and psychological prerequisites on which moral concerns are built, the necessary social input that gives rise to the emergence of moral thought, and the child’s own contribution to the construction of morality. In addition to classical observation and interview techniques, my lab uses eye-tracking and neurophysiological measures to study early social-cognitive and moral development. We have examined the neural correlates of infants’ emerging prosociality and infant precursors of moral development. Further work along these lines has uncovered that young children’s reliance on fairness principles changes in the course of the preschool years, and that children enforce norms of fairness towards others. We have also found that the different facets of moral considerations so far employed in developmental research do not always relate to each other. This points to unchartered territory in the study of moral development. We now aim to raise this research endeavor to a next level by more systematically addressing the developmental foundations of human morality. With support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation, I will take this research line forward by examining: 1) young children’s behavior and experiences in naturalistic settings. Modern observational tools and techniques will give us unique insights into children’s emerging real life engagement with moral concerns 2) the extent to which children’s developing moral understanding can be analyzed in terms of conceptual development. To which extent does moral reasoning form an independent domain or is interrelated with other domains of knowledge? 3) children’s perception and processing of morally relevant information. Eye-tracking methods and neurophysiological measurements will be used to address this question.

How young children conceptualize events en route to learning relational language has been the subject of my research. Adopting an interdisciplinary, multi-method, and cross-linguistic approach, we have investigated how infants and children represent the units within events that serve language and how this representation becomes differentially codified in languages around the world. We argue that to learn relational words, infants first universally notice a common set of foundational components in events – dividing the world in language-ready ways. As children learn how to express event components in their native language, they highlight certain components over others and metaphorically trade spaces; moving from being ‘language-generalists’ to ‘language-specific interpreters’ of events. In the process of learning relational language, infants not only attend to components of events, but language might also serve as a tool for constructing complex event concepts. Up to this point, we have largely examined infants’ event representations and language learning for motion events and causal events in typically developing children’s first language acquisition. We have found support for the trading spaces framework. Infants attend to a variety of components within events such as path (the trajectory of motion), manner (how an action is performed), figure (the agent of an action), and ground (where an action occurs). Later, sensitivity to distinctions in events can be highlighted or dampened as children gain exposure to the patterns in their native language, achieving new perspectives on events. We also offered a bidirectional relation between event perception and language learning. Some event categories such as complex causal events (e.g., preventing a person to reach a goal) are revealed only through language as children grasp the specific meaning of events. The proposed research builds on these studies on event representation and language learning. The main aim is to identify the exact nature of the link between conceptualization of events and language learning and pinpoint the mechanisms involved in the process of trading spaces. The goals of the current project are (1) to investigate event representations and learning relational language from a cross-linguistic perspective at different levels of representations (behavioral and neural), (2) to examine developmental trajectories for children who are raised bilingual, (3) to test children who may have atypical developmental trajectories such as brain injured children to address issues related to plasticity, and (4) to illustrate individual differences of both typically and atypically developing children in longitudinal studies. These research lines will elucidate theories on early language learning, particularly on the early interactions between language and thought in monolingual and bilingual children and will streamline our own theory of trading spaces, and provide insights onto the interventions for atypical language learning.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Koç University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020510\\n', 'year': '2017', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

According to anthropological reports, it is not until many months later, when the baby has become a talking toddler, that the mother will speak directly to her. Both children will come to learn language, but will this happen at the same rate and following the same process? The answer to this question is relevant not only to our understanding of cognitive development, but also to redressing inequalities. In fact, some previous work, including from randomized control trials, suggests that quantity and quality of speech experienced early on promotes cognitive development, and eventually has positive impacts on academic performance and economic outcomes. How do cultural differences in early input contribute to long-term effects? My work focuses on how young children learn their native language(s). More specifically, I aim to shed light on the learning mechanisms that are involved in the acquisition process. I employ an interdisciplinary, multi-method approach: Audio- and video-recordings and controlled experiments are used to document infants’ input and outcomes; meta-analyses, to integrate across multiple (necessarily partial and noisy) results; and computational models, to better describe the input exhaustively, and check whether a hypothetical mechanistic explanation linking experiences to outcomes is actually feasible.

Math skills are portals to careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and are crucial tools in everyday life, from financial and medical decision-making to understanding the national debt. Unfortunately, many students fail to reach their potential in mathematics, and the roots of these disparities can be traced to school entry. Remediating these disparities requires a detailed understanding of the cognitive processes through which young children learn math concepts, why some children suffer from anxiety and low motivation, and how cognitive and motivational processes work together to influence long-term developmental trajectories. A distinctive aspect of my research program involves the growing recognition of the importance of spatial skills, like mental rotation and proportional reasoning, for understanding variations in math achievement. Spatial skills predict interest and success in mathematics starting in pre-k and can be substantially improved at all ages. Therefore, enhancing spatial skills may represent a powerful and currently underutilized leverage point for enhancing children’s mathematical development. In both spatial and numerical domains, my research investigates individual differences in learners (e.g., numerical concepts, spatial skills, strategy use, and motivation) and in learning environments (e.g., parents, teachers, and specific learning materials) in the hope of discovering key cognitive and motivational processes that set children onto positive trajectories in mathematics. In the coming years, I plan to investigate links between spatial and numerical development in three inter-related ways. First, I will develop a fine-grained model of the relations between specific spatial skills and specific numerical skills, and investigate whether these relations change with age. For example, the number line is an important representation that aligns spatial and numerical magnitudes and might explain relations between spatial skills and numeracy in early childhood. Second, I ask how young children develop the ability to flexibly focus on either numerical magnitudes (i.e., numbers of discrete objects) or spatial magnitudes (i.e., continuous quantities like surface area) when those magnitudes are in conflict – such as comparing 4 large stars to 10 tiny stars - and what experiences can improve this ability. Third, I will examine how parents’ cognitive and motivational support – such as spatial language, gesture, praise, and talk about ability – jointly impact children’s spatial and numerical skills, motivation, and long-term trajectories in STEM. This research program is multi-method, including correlational, longitudinal, observational, and experimental approaches; correlational and longitudinal studies inform later randomized experiments aimed at testing causal relations, and experimental studies inform observational and longitudinal research to determine whether processes established in the lab also occur in the real world. Together, these studies will contribute to a deeper understanding of the inter-relations between spatial and numerical thinking in childhood, how parent interactions influence the development of these cognitive skills, and how cognitive and motivational factors work together to influence children’s trajectories in STEM. The long-term goal of this research is to uncover critical leverage points and translation-ready insights that can improve children’s mathematical skills and motivation.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Temple University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020546\\n', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

From parent-child interactions to formal pedagogy, humans learn in rich, diverse social contexts. While many nonhuman species learn from observing their conspecifics, only humans engage in a range of epistemic practices that actively recruit their conspecifics; by querying and interpreting information from others and providing information for others, humans incrementally build knowledge over generations, and even create cultural institutions (e.g., schools) to facilitate this process. What makes human learning so distinctive, powerful and effective? My research addresses this question by studying the cognitive mechanisms that support social learning. A basic premise that guides my research is that our understanding of the physical world develops in tandem with our understanding of the social world. Successfully learning about both requires the integration of a host of cognitive faculties, which may have different origins and developmental trajectories. Thus a major goal of my research program is to identify the core components of cognition that underlie how we learn and help others learn, and explain how they give rise to distinctively human epistemic practices that naturally manifest in early childhood. Yet, learning means more than acquiring knowledge about the external world; building a coherent, positive self-representation is one of the most important challenges in early learning. Even though we recognize the importance of self-concept in cultivating curiosity, persistence, and resilience, little is known about how children learn about the inner world (i.e., the self) and the role of early experiences.  My current proposal is that humans, starting early in life, (1) acquire new knowledge from others by drawing powerful inferences that go beyond the evidence, and (2) share their own knowledge by generating evidence that helps others learn; critically, (3) these epistemic practices naturally manifest not only as we learn and communicate about the external world, but also about the inner world. Using a combination of developmental and computational approaches, my research is making systematic progress to provide support for this idea. Even young children actively interpret and communicate information about the world and themselves, and in turn, their growing knowledge about the world and the desire to construct a positive self-concept modulate their behaviors as learners and as teachers. These results challenge the traditional view that social learning primarily involves one-way transmission of information, and that young children are passive recipients in this process; it is a cooperative, bidirectional exchange of information, and its richness and sophistication may be rooted in early-emerging cognitive capacities such as the ability to reason about others’ mental states and as well as their utilities. Learning is a generative process that continues throughout the lifespan; the more we know, the more we want to know, and the better we can improve ourselves. By characterizing the cognitive foundations of social learning and the complex interplay between cognition and motivation, my research will provide key insights for a unified theory of human learning, and inspire better educational practices that can   generate, sustain, and foster our drive to learn and help others learn.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Stanford University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020545\\n', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Children, in contrast, are anything but epistemically indifferent; they are curious, eager, active learners. Indeed, in the course of development, children repeatedly refine their beliefs. Sometimes learning is fast and flexible, other times it is protracted and rigid. Sometimes learning is most efficient during self-guided play, other times direct instruction is more effective. And, sometimes children (and adults) eagerly explore to push the boundaries of their knowledge, while other times they are untroubled by their relative ignorance. Studying learning in early childhood provides a unique opportunity to resolve these dichotomies. To this end, my research has focused on the epistemic stance that young learners take, asking: (1) How evidence interacts with prior beliefs in causal learning; (2) How evidence is interpreted in different contexts and shapes play in these contexts; (3) What past experiences drive particular individuals in certain contexts to want to seek out more evidence and, more generally, to be curious. The “theory theory” provides an initial framework for addressing children's causal learning. Causal beliefs can be thought of as naïve “theories” that support explanation, prediction, and exploration, and that are revisable in light of new evidence (Carey 1985; Gopnik & Meltzof, 1997; Keil, 1992; Wellman & Gelman, 1992). This framework suggests that children may be particularly well adapted to attend to evidence, but it has failed to explain why learning can be fast and flexible or protracted and rigid. Furthermore, the role of naïve theories in guiding children’s play, and the role of play in shaping theories, has been underspecified. Although researchers have long agreed that children can and do learn through play (e.g., Bruner, Jolly, & Sylva, 1976), little is known about why learning is sometimes more efficient during self-guided play, and at other times during direct instruction. Finally, although theorists have long appreciated the importance of human curiosity in learning (Berlyn, 1960), few studies have attempted to specify how past experiences may lead to individual differences in this drive. My research program aims to resolve these dichotomies and formally to characterize the interactions between children’s learning, play, and curiosity. Doing so requires precise, explicit theoretical assumptions that produce empirically testable predictions. Thus, in addition to studies of children's learning, I use computational modeling to formalize theoretical intuitions.\nUnderstanding the generalities as well as the heterogeneities of learning throughout the lifespan also requires a “domain-diverse” and “age-diverse” program. My research draws on multiple domains of causal learning, investigating children’s acquisition of biological, psychological, and physical knowledge. Discovery of general principles also requires diversity of sampling; I investigate learning across the entire range of development. My primary goal is to understand how learning develops, identifying both general principles of learning as well as specific constraints that may influence individual differences in epistemic stance.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020544\\n', 'year': '2018', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Psychologists addressing this problem have long proposed that we must have a capacity for hierarchical control, or the ability to simultaneously control immediate actions while also holding more abstract goals in mind. Consider an everyday task like making coffee. Behaviorists explained this task as an action-trigger chain, wherein grinding beans triggers putting the grounds in the coffee machine, and so forth. However, people sometimes forget or reverse individual steps of a task, but still proceed with the next steps (e.g., starting the coffee machine having forgotten the grounds). Chaining cannot account for these \"broken links\". Rather, such slips suggested to cognitive psychologists that we hold an abstract, overarching task context in mind, which runs in the background and influences more specific choices. Similar hierarchical abstractions also influence rule-governed behavior. For example, as\r\nchildren, we learn rules like speak softly when indoors (\"indoor voice\"), but outside, it is okay to\r\nshout. Here, an element of the context (i.e., indoor) constrains one's manner of speaking.\r\nHowever, children may eventually learn that the \"indoor voice\" rule is among the broader class\r\nof rules that only apply when a caregiver is present. Hence, \"Mom\" provides an overarching\r\ncontextual element that determines a class of other context-action relationships. Processes\r\nsupporting such hierarchical abstractions may underlie learning, planning, decision making, and\r\nreasoning. Yet, despite its importance for cognition, the cognitive and neural mechanisms that\r\nsupport hierarchical control remain unknown. In my lab, we have gained new understanding of this longstanding problem using a\r\ncomputational cognitive neuroscience approach. We have built on recent empirical and\r\ntheoretical innovations in working memory and reinforcement learning to generate novel\r\nhypotheses about the mechanisms of hierarchical control, including by building explicit\r\ncomputational models. This theoretical work has highlighted a capacity termed supporting hierarchical control, which is the ability to hold one overarching element of\r\ncontext in working memory in order to influence what else is maintained. We test our\r\nhypotheses using a range of cognitive neuroscience methods, including behavioral\r\nexperimentation, functional and structural brain imaging, and testing neurological patients.\r\nThese experiments have provided evidence that nested circuits between frontal cortex and\r\nstriatum may support contingent updating during hierarchical control. In light of the importance\r\nof hierarchical control, this relatively simple circuit, when elaborated in the human brain, may be\r\na core component in our capacity for goal-directed thought and action. My lab is extending this research in several new directions.

The rush to make sense of these data has so far largely produced models that are as complicated as the data themselves. When phenomenological models are sought, degrees of freedom often are eliminated in an manner based on data availability or preferences of the modeler. These approaches fail in quantitative predictions of biological system functions the same way they have failed in many problems in the study of complex phenomena in the physical world. The of complex systems is their interdependence, and a naïve attempt at elimination of certain degrees of freedom is tantamount to throwing the baby out with the bath water. The central theme of my thinking is the development of theoretical approaches that, in contrast to the existing ones, do not eliminate essential degrees of freedom and functional properties of biological systems. I am convinced that . The descriptions may take longer to write down than a simple Hooke's law, but there is no a priori reason why it should remain that \"the best ... model of a cat is another ... cat.\" There is a dearth of theoretical and computational frameworks that one can use for this task. And yet the theory of statistical inference argues that optimal understanding, prediction, and generalization is achieved in models that eliminate details. The main difference from inanimate matter is not the complexity , but our inability to identify the relevant degrees of freedom to be preserved while coarse-graining. The question is not but rather and  My research group has been addressing this problem. The key difference from earlier attempts has been the focus on objectively selecting the relevant features for the models. We have used tools from stochastic processes theory, statistical mechanics, and information theory to build the analytical framework for this. We have applied the framework to biological systems that provided the best opportunities for testing the ideas. These included basic enzymatic reactions, complex biochemical networks of kinetic proofreading, and data-driven empirical models of the tumor necrosis factor signaling. We have only scratched the surface, and more theoretical work and biological examples are needed to understand if our hypothesis is correct.

While treatment options have not accelerated as rapidly as any of us would like, great strides have been made\r\nin understanding the molecular mechanisms contributing to GBM growth.

Our proposal originates in the Department of Neurology, while drawing\r\non resources from Neurosurgery, Pathology, Radiology, and the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center. Approximately 70% of GBMs exhibit abnormally activated AKT signaling. AKT\r\nactivates several targets including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),\r\nstimulating multiple oncogenic processes (Fig. 1). AKT and mTOR are crucial\r\nactors in the etiology and growth of brain tumors, and this signaling axis has\r\nemerged as a compelling molecular target in GBM. is a commercially available agent that is approved for use in\r\nkidney cancer. This agent inhibits mTOR, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and\r\nachieves therapeutic concentrations in brain tumor tissue.[1] However, it has\r\nonly modest antitumor activity as a single agent in recurrent GBMs.[2, 3] One of\r\nthe reasons temsirolimus alone is ineffective in treatment of GBMs is that inhibition of mTOR activates AKT\r\nthrough a feedback loop, which also drives GBM growth. [4-6] Our goal, then, is to allow temsirolimus to\r\nimpede mTOR, while avoiding a simultaneous increase in AKT activation. is a recently developed drug designed to function as an AKT inhibitor.[7] It is being studied as a\r\ntreatment for sarcoma, melanoma, and other cancers as well as brain tumors.[8-13] As is the case with\r\ninhibiting mTOR, impeding AKT alone with perifosine alone is insufficient in treating GBM.[14] Our working hypothesis is that a combination of temsirolimus and perifosine will prove more effective against\r\nGBMs than either drug alone. Moreover, working together these agents will provide a more promising course\r\nof treatment than anything currently available pharmaceutically for patients with recurrent GBMs. A phase I\r\ntrial of the combination, developed by the Principal Investigator of this grant (Andrew B. Lassman, MD) and\r\nconducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), is reaching its conclusion. Among 26\r\npatients accrued to date, there was one dose limiting toxicity (thrombocytopenia) in a patient who was heavily\r\npre-treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. There were no grade 4 (or 5) toxicities.[15] The maximum\r\ntolerated dose (MTD) of the combination therapy far exceeds the dose of temsirolimus that can be combined\r\nwith other small molecule inhibitors such as sorafinib (25 mg weekly temsirolimus)[16] or erlotinib (15 mg weekly temsirolimus)[17]; the inability to give higher doses may have contributed to poor blood-brain-barrier\r\npenetration and lack of efficacy with these other combinations.

This question has vexed scholars for centuries. It lead Plato to formulate one of the first arguments from poverty of the stimulus. He concluded that representations of the abstract are not learnable from experience, and must instead be recollected from past incarnations of our souls. Wallace, a co-originator of the theory of natural selection alongside Darwin, became so frustrated with the problem of abstract thought that he argued natural selection should be scrapped altogether (Darwin intervened). One potential solution to this mystery is suggested by patterns in language. When talking about the abstract and complex, we rely heavily on systems of metaphors, borrowing terms and constructions from more concrete or perceptually rich domains (1). Is it possible that we think about the abstract the way we talk about it: as a patchwork of metaphors? In my work, I have generated and empirically tested the key predictions from this theoretical approach. Our results demonstrate that people build up abstract knowledge through incremental (and sometimes iterative) borrowings or analogies from more perceptual or experience-based knowledge. Further, the particular patterns of such borrowings depend on the metaphors that exist in languages and cultures. Finally, representations of abstract or complex domains are not fully articulated logically cohesive knowledge structures (as we may aspire to), but rather a patchwork of many different (sometimes conflicting) structures that are brought to mind for different purposes and offer only an illusion of coherence. These findings suggest that evolutionary adaptations for perception and action (and formative perceptuo-motor experience) help guide and constrain some of our most sophisticated cognitive endeavors. At the same time, complex knowledge is not simply a product of physiological endowment or physical experience. It is actively constructed through structures that exist in the social world: in language and culture. Our current and future work aims to understand in detail the mechanisms through which knowledge from perception and action and from language and culture is combined to create the amazing complexity and sophistication of the human knowledge system. One extension of this work has been to more broadly investigate how the languages we speak shape the ways we think. This question has long been of central interest in philosophy, linguistics, anthropology and psychology. However, despite nearly constant attention and debate, very little empirical work had been done on this question until recently. For a long time, the idea that language might shape thought was considered at best untestable and more often simply crazy and wrong. Research in my lab has helped reopen this question. We have looked at how speakers of different languages think about colors, objects, space, time, events, and causality, finding cross-linguistic differences in each case. Beyond simply demonstrating cross-linguistic differences, this work is revealing the many different ways that linguistic processes interact with the rest of cognition, and the underlying mechanisms through which the languages we speak shape and construct our reality.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Stanford University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020237', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Since T-cell immunotherapies are highly tumor-specific and cause minimal bystander cell damage,\r\nthey are an attractive therapeutic strategy to improve the current dismal outcome for GBM patients.  Gene transfer allows the rapid generation of antigen-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy, and this\r\napproach can circumvent tolerance to self-antigens overexpressed by tumor cells. Successful gene transfer\r\nstrategies include the forced expression of antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or α/β T-cell\r\nreceptors (TCR). We propose to take advantage of CARs to target GBM antigens. CARs consist of a single\r\nchain variable fragment (scFv), a transmembrane domain, and signaling domains derived from the T-cell\r\nreceptor (TCR) complex and costimulatory molecules. CARs combine the antigen-binding property of\r\nmonoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with the lytic capacity and self-renewal of T cells and have several advantages\r\nover α/β TCR. CAR-expressing T cells recognize and kill tumor cells in an MHC unrestricted fashion, so that\r\ntarget cell recognition by CAR-T cells is unaffected by some of the major mechanisms by which tumors avoid\r\nMHC-restricted T-cell α/β TCR) recognition, such as downregulation of HLA class I molecules and defective\r\nantigen processing. Other advantages of CARs include the ability to change T-cell specificity by expressing a\r\nsingle molecule, which obviates the need to express two different receptor molecules at high levels from a\r\nsingle vector; and to ensure correct pairing of the introduced molecules, requirements that have proved\r\nproblematic for transgenic α/β TCRs. Lastly, most tumors do not express costimulatory molecules so that α/β\r\nTCR engagement is followed by incomplete T-cell activation. This limitation can be overcome for CARs by\r\nincorporating costimulatory endodomains within the chimeric receptor sequence. The clinical experience with\r\nCAR-T cells for GBMs is limited, but given the recent encouraging clinical results using CAR-T cells to treat\r\nGD2-positive neuroblastoma and CD19-positive leukemia, further exploration is warranted. CAR-T cells can recognize antigens expressed on the cell surface of GBMs. Potential membrane-bound tumor\r\nantigens include EGFRvIII, IL13Rα2, GPNMB, and EphA2. Immune escape mutants have been described\r\nfor EGFRvIII- and IL13Rα2-targeted therapies. Targeting antigens that are important for sustaining the\r\nmalignant GBM phenotype should reduce the inherent risk of immune escape and we therefore propose to\r\ntarget EphA2, an antigen that is important for the malignant phenotype of GBMs. EphA2 is overexpressed in\r\nGBM and is associated with poor outcomes. EphA2 overexpression induces pro-oncogenic effects\r\nincluding enhanced tumorigenesis, tumor cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasiss. We have shown in preclinical models that T cells, genetically engineered to be specific for EphA2, recognize\r\nnot only the bulk of GBM cells but also glioma stem cells. In addition, these cells induced the regression of\r\nhuman GBMs grown in the brain of SCID mice. Approximately half of the animals become long-term survivors\r\nin the absence of evident toxicities. In an effort to further increase the success rate of EphA2-targeted GBM therapies and move closer to a Phase\r\nI clinical study in humans we will pursue 2 strategies and expand the preclinical animal models we currently\r\nuse to evaluate our GBM targeted T-cell therapies. First, we will explore mechanisms by which we can\r\nincrease the expansion of CAR-T cells and sustain their survival. Second, we will determine if targeting\r\none additional GBM antigen will result in enhanced anti-GBM effects. Lastly, we will adapt an immune\r\ncompetent animal model to evaluate EphA2-targeted T-cell Therapies.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Baylor College of Medicine', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020317\\n', 'year': '2012', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Medulloblastomas break into 4 classes, two of which harbour mutations in two well known pathways that regulate the normal development of the brain: Sonic Hedgehog/Patched (Shh) and Wnt (Thompson et al, 2006). Despite recent success in treating medulloblastomas using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation; one third remain incurable (Maleci et al. 1992; Roberts et al. 1991). Additionally, current therapies cause problems in normal brain development, including reduction of IQ, that greatly affect the quality of life of survivors (Gajjar et al. 2006). Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults and in children, is extremely difficult to treat, with a median survival of around one year. Despite advances in chemo- and radiation therapy, the 5-year survival rate for GBM has not improved in the last 30 years and currently is still less than 3% (Ohgaki and Kleihues 2005). Clearly, new and better therapies are needed for these brain cancers. Medulloblastomas are believed to originate in specific cells in the developing brain, granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), that fail to stop dividing when they are supposed to do so during cerebellum development. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is the major regulator that drives proliferation of GNPs (Wechsler-Reya and Scott 2001). Mutations in Shh, or its helper proteins, occur in ~25% of patients with medulloblastoma (Thompson et al. 2006). Although an inhibitor of Shh signaling (HH antag) causes medulloblastoma-cells to stop dividing and assume their proper function and eliminates tumor formation in mice, treatment of young animals with this compound causes abnormal bone development (Kimura et al. 2008). Because patients with medulloblastoma would be treated at the time when their bone growth is at its peak, this compound is likely to severely affect the growth of children. Thus we have been interested in the identification of novel therapeutic targets that inhibit tumor development without causing such side effects. We have developed mouse models of medulloblastoma that faithfully mimic the human tumors that have problems with the control of cell fate by Shh. We genetically engineered mice that lacked a copy of the Patched gene and two copies of the cell cycle negative regulatory protein, p18Ink4c, two proteins found mutated (Easton et al. 1998) or down regulated (Schwaller et al. 1997), respectively, in human tumors. We confirmed by  molecular analysis that mouse medulloblastoma that occur in our [Cdkn2c-/-; Ptch1+/-] and [Cdkn2c-/-; p53-/-] mice (Zindy et al. 2007) mimic human medulloblastomas with a Shh \"signature\". We recently found that bone morphogenic proteins (BMP2, 4 and 7) reverse Shh-dependent cell growth and cause tumor cells to convert into neurons. BMP molecules are critical in the development of all organisms throughout evolution from flies to man (See Figure 1 for a description of the BMP signaling pathway). Differentiation of GNP's is mediated in part by the rapid inactivation of the transcription factor Atonal (Atoh1) (Zhao et al., 2008) which is critical for normal GNP cell function in brain development (Ben-Arie et al. 1997). Analysis of the BMP pathway showed that it is largely shut down at the genetic level whereas Atoh1 is highly active both in mouse and human MBs (Zhao et al. 2008). Besides their relevance in inhibiting medulloblastoma, BMP2, 4 and 7 also block the development of other cancers, including glioblastoma. BMP4 stops the proliferation of tumor-initiating cells that cause GBMs both in vitro and in vivo (Piccirillo et al. 2006). Children's tumors originating from the gonads downregulate the BMP pathway suggesting that its reactivation may be critical for the treatment of these tumors (James Amatruda, personal communication). In vivo, daily systemic administration of BMP7 significantly inhibits growth of breast cancer cells metastasized to the bones of nude mice (Buijs et al. 2007). All these results suggest that BMP2, 4, and 7 have broad therapeutic use. However, several drawbacks are related to the use of BMPs as therapeutic agents. First, the production of recombinant BMPs is costly, probably reaching costs of greater than $50,000 per treatment course. Second, to reach the effective doses would require giving very large amounts of the BMP's (Schmidmaier et al. 2008) that could lead to severe side effects such as inflammation, edema and abnormal bone formation (Gottfried and Dailey 2008). Because Shh antagonists and BMPs can act together, BMP agonists/activators could be combined with Shh antagonists to lower doses of Shh antagonist and potentially diminish the side effects, especially the inhibition of bone development. In summary, we have generated mouse models that faithfully mimic medulloblastoma with improperly functioning Shh and have begun to use them as preclinical models (Ayrault et al. 2009). We believe that BMP signaling is an attractive target because tumor cells will be induced to differentiate in neurons and eliminated, leaving normal neurons intact. In addition, small molecule agonists/activators of BMP signaling should be more effective and less toxic therapeutic agents than BMP itself. This grant application describes our preliminary data and experimental plan toward the identification of small molecules that activate the BMP pathway using a high throughput screen of a large library of compounds (~ 525,000) and the validation of their function in tumor cells, with a hope to use them in the future in the clinic.

In that series of novels, Dr. Asimov imagined a new branch of science that he dubbed \"psychohistory\"-a theory of mathematical sociology whereby the large-scale behavior of human societies could be predicted. While the idea of psychohistory remains mostly in the realm of science fiction, simple mathematical models of various aspects of human behavior have appeared in the scientific literature with increasing frequency in recent years. Though still few in number, successful examples demonstrate that analytically tractable systems of equations can usefully capture important aspects of the way humans behave in groups. Furthermore, the very process of paring down a complex system in order to create a simplified mathematical model gives insight into the critical components that most strongly determine how such a system behaves. This proposal consists of a variety of projects connected by the common theme of group behavior: all of the proposed topics can be seen as systems with two or more groups competing for members. In the past, limitations on data made it difficult to test mathematical models such as these, discouraging their development. Today, a growing set of large historical databases is available, making it possible for the first time to quantitatively test many predictions of theoretical models of social behavior. I believe that the projects proposed below are only the tip of the iceberg for convincing dynamical representations of human social systems. Other approaches to social systems, such as agent-based modeling or econometric analysis, reveal that many systems obey understandable rules and are statistically predictable to varying extents. The addition of rigorous dynamical models would be of great benefit both for their predictive power and the insight gained into fundamental aspects of these complex problems. The big questions to be addressed include: The 2008 American Religious Identification Survey by Trinity College found that Americans who don't identify with any particular religious group are the fastest growing religious minority and currently comprise about 15% of the population; a 2010 Pew survey found that more than 25% of Americans born after 1980 are religiously unaffiliated. Many other countries have experienced similar shifts in religious beliefs during the past half century: in the Netherlands, for example, those who affiliate with a religious group are now in the minority. What is driving this rapid and historically unprecedented movement away from organized religion? Is it likely to continue or reverse? Can we make any predictions about the future of religious identification? This project would be based on a model of competition between religious groups and the \"unaffiliated\" group for adherents. Previous research has shown that this type of model can be analyzed mathematically with only minimal information about the response of individuals to social pressure, giving deep insight into underlying causes. Quantitative predictions will depend on construction of sufficiently large historical data sets, which are available through government census records for a significant number of countries worldwide. In recent years a disturbing trend had become increasingly difficult to ignore: languages around the world are dying. The last speaker has already been born for an estimated 90% of world languages. The typical case is that a so-called \"killer\" language (e.g., English, French, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, or Mandarin Chinese) takes root in a region where the native language is not protected by political borders, and, through economic or political influence, gradually becomes the dominant regional language. The time scale for a shift in regional language can be as short as 50 years. In such cases, it is not uncommon for children to be unable to communicate fluently with their grandparents. Previous models of this phenomenon have identified two key factors driving language change. The first factor is a majority effect: individuals have an advantage if they can communicate with a larger fraction of their peers, and therefore gain by switching to a majority language. The second factor is a socalled \"status\" effect: society may provide greater benefits (e.g., economic, political) to speakers of a language perceived to have higher status, and thus individuals have an incentive to switch to that language to gain the benefits. A typical example might be university education available only in a higher prestige language. The author published a simple mathematical model incorporating these two key factors in 2003. Subject to very mild assumptions, the model made the surprising and disheartening prediction that, in the long run, only a single language can persist, with the bilingual society unstable. Furthermore, numerical simulation of the model matched historical data for a variety of declining world languages. A caveat to the pessimistic predictions of the 2003 model, however, is its limited applicability: the numerical fits worked best for very small regions. Real human populations consist of a social network linking various members of the community. Because the model assumed that all members of society interact equally with one another, it couldn't be applied well to large distributed populations. So-called \"small-world\" networks have been shown to be good models for human societies. Understanding how the social structure of a society can promote or discourage language change is an important step in building useful strategies for language preservation. This project will incorporate network effects mathematically, as well as through data collected as part of field research in the Peruvian Andes to be conducted in 2010. Between 1980 and 2008, overall U.S. adult obesity rates increased from 15% to 30%, with even more dramatic increases concentrated in some regions of the country. In 2007 Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler used data from the Framingham Heart Study (a 32-year longitudinal study tracking weights and social connections for 12,067 individuals) to show that the chance of an individual becoming obese was strongly correlated with obesity rates among neighbors in his or her the social network. Besides having important clinical implications, this discovery provides an ideal basis for a dynamical model of obesity. Such a model would be of great use in understanding the key factors underlying the current epidemic and in highlighting changes that may affect the future prevalence of obesity. The proposed project entails creation of both a \"compartmental\" and a \"continuous\" competitive model, in which individuals shift weights with probabilities dependent on both intrinsic biological parameters and social factors. The goal is to explain today's distribution of weights in the US population as a steady-state of the model, and then to extend predictions to the future. Parameters for the model will be kept to a minimum, and focus made on mathematically rigorous statements about behavior of the model. The percentage of the population that is left-handed (about 10%) is very consistent among world cultures today, and studies of skeletal remains indicate that it has remained fairly constant since prehistoric times. This suggests that there may be an inherent advantage to the rarity of left-handers. The percentage left-handed changes considerably in the world of professional sports, however, approaching 50% among leading baseball players or boxers. The traditional explanation for this observation is that sports focused on individual physical competition yield an advantage for the competitor who is different. For example, a single left-handed boxer in an otherwise right-handed league would have the advantage of extensive experience against right-handers, but opponents would have no experience against left-handers. If competition were the only effect at play, then we would expect to see a human population with approximately 50% left-handed and 50% right-handed, since a competitive advantage would lead to relative growth of the left-handed population until the advantage disappeared. The fact that left-handers are indeed rare implies that there is some evolutionary disadvantage to nonconformity. The observed fraction of left-handers must represent a balance between the competing influences of conformity and competition. A successful model of this phenomenon would give insight into factors affecting human evolutionary history. The problem will be approached in a manner similar to others previously described, imagining a \"lefty\" group and a \"righty\" group competing for members on evolutionary time scales. Individual competitive fitness would necessarily increase with membership in the minority group, but overall group fitness would favor conformity.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Northwestern University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020230\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '278,860', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

And why do we experience that our centre-of-awareness is located inside a physical body? These fundamental questions have been discussed in theology, philosophy, and psychology for centuries, but have been considered inaccessible to experimental investigation until recently. In neurology, it is known that people with damage to their premotor or posterior parietal lobes can fail to recognize their own limbs. However, although this indicates that the frontal and parietal association cortices are somehow involved in a sense of body ownership, little was known about how this is achieved. The aim of our research programe is to identify the perceptual processes and neuronal mechanisms that mediate the feeling of ownership of one's body. Our hypothesis is that parts of one's own body are distinguished from objects in the external world by the specific patterns of correlated signals from the different sensory modalities they produce. In this model ownership corresponds to the perceptual fusion of visual, tactile and proprioceptive information into a coherent object that is a body-part. This multisensory integration process is obeying precise temporal and spatial congruency principles, is limited to the space near the body, and is operating in body-part-centered reference frames. It is hypothesized that the integration is implemented by populations of neurons in the premotor cortex, intraparietal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, areas which in non-human primates contain cells with the capacity to integrate visual, tactile and proprioceptive signals. To test this model, we will use perceptual illusions where people experience dramatic changes in ownership of their body. For example, healthy volunteers will perceive another individual's body as their own, rubber hands as being part of their own body, or 'out-of-body' illusions, where ownership is projected outside the real body. These illusions are triggered by specific patterns of multisensory stimuli, and the identification of these patterns informs us about the principles governing the elicitation of ownership. Importantly, we can use these illusions as experimental tools in conjunction with complementary neuroimaging and neurodisruptive techniques to test the specific neuronal hypotheses outlined above. Our research program will lead to major advances in our understanding of how the brain represents one's own body and will have important clinical and industrial applications. Identifying the mechanisms of ownership will enable the investigation of its possible breakdown in neurological and psychiatric disorders with disturbances in body ownership (such as body neglect after stroke; anosognosia; bodily delusions and hallucinations). Further, it will allow the controlled projection of ownership to be extended to artificial and virtual limbs and bodies. For example, we have already initiated the development of novel prosthetic limbs that feel like real limbs even without invasive interfaces, and of virtual reality applications where the sense of body ownership is seamlessly projected onto virtual bodies.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Karolinska Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020233\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In an AM radio transmission, a signal is generated at a frequency that corresponds to a specific rate of amplitude modulation (the 'AM'). This AM signal carries information content like music or a talk-show and is broadcast via an antenna from the local radio station. To capture this transmitted AM signal, your radio uses another antenna, but this antenna is non-specific--it will capture any and all AM signals that impinge upon it. To hear a specific radio station, your radio uses a tuner. This tuner can be used to pick out one specific frequency and does so using a principle called 'resonance', a process that filters out unwanted signals by only amplifying that one specific frequency. During vocal communication, the speaker is the radio station broadcasting an AM speech signal via the mouth, and that this signal (as well as all the other noises in the background) is picked up by the antenna-like ears of the listener. The listener's brain is pre-tuned to the specific AM frequency of the speech signal and thus amplifies it through resonance. What is this particular radio station? Well, it's not actually a specific frequency, but rather a narrow range: 3-8Hz. The structure of the speech signal is amplitude modulated with a 3-8Hz frequency that resonates with on-going oscillations in the auditory regions of the listener's brain that are also 3-8Hz in frequency. To further amplify this vocal signal in noisy environments, humans evolved rhythmic facial movements with the same frequency to accompany speech. These rhythms divide up or 'chunk' the speech rhythm so that the listener's brain can efficiently extract meaningful information from the signal. According to this framework, vocal communication through the interactions between the brain and body of the signaler along with the body and brain of the receiver. This perspective makes explicit the idea that behavior is a circular process, flowing through the nervous system into the muscles and re-entering the nervous system through the sense organs on each side of a communicative exchange. That is, while we typically think that signals between parts of the brain take place only through anatomical connections, in fact, neural states can influence other neural states with the environment as a conduit. Take, for example, just one side of a conversation. A speaker, without any awareness of doing so, adjusts the production of his or her own speech patterns by monitoring how it sounds in a given context. The motor areas of the brain generates a program to say something, the body complies, producing an acoustic signal that mixes in the air with ambient noise. This sound travels back to the speaker's ears and auditory system and thus acts as a feedback signal telling the motor system to adjust vocal output if necessary. Research in my lab focuses on showing how a similar process occurs when two people or two monkeys are communicating with each other. That is, we're trying to understand how communication between the motor parts of the speaker's brain and the auditory parts of the listener's brain is coordinated through the vocal signal, with the air as a conduit--and how this process may have changed over the course of human evolution.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Princeton University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020238\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In prior research, we have established that: a) therapeutically engineered adult neural stem cells migrate extensively to tumors and to infiltrating deposits in the brain (2) and have apoptotic effects when transplanted into mouse models of glioma (3-5); and b) the dynamics of targeted anti-tumor therapies and fate of stem cells can be visualized in real time (5-6). In order to circumvent, the ethical and isolation problems associated with employing adult and ES derived NSC, we and others (7) have recently generated NSC from induced pluripotent stem cells (ipNSC) that were previously derived from mouse fibroblasts. The long term goal of this proposal is to develop therapeutic ipNSC to study stem cell based anti-angiogenic and combined anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic therapies in different brain tumor models. Recent phase II clinical studies provide evidence that delivery of anti-angiogenic drugs through vasculature transiently normalize the abnormal structure and function of the blood vessels and result in reduction of tumor-associated vasogenic brain edema resulting in clinical benefit in most patients (8-9). Evidence from a number of pre-clinical models suggest that anti-angiogenic agents, when used judiciously, 'normalize' tumor vessels and enhance the delivery and efficacy of concurrently administered cytotoxic agents (8,10,11). However, recent studies have shown that vessel normalization in the tumor bearing brains in mice result in the restoration of blood brain barrier and consequential inefficient delivery of cytotoxic drugs to brain tumors (12,13) thus disputing the existing rationale on the use of anti-angiogenic agents in combination with cytotoxic agents in pre-clinical and clinical settings. These results have raised fundamental questions about how anti-angiogenic agents and cytotoxic drugs can be used in combination in the clinic to 1) normalize tumor vasculature; and 2) enhance the outcome of cytotoxic therapy within the normalization window for brain tumors? A number of studies provide evidence that upregulation of endogenous TSP-1 decreases vessel permeability (8,10,14) and its expression is upregulated in intact p53 tumor cells [15]. Based on the observations that short biological half-life of many of the currently used antiangiogenic inhibitors and the impaired intratumoral blood flow create logistical difficulties for effective normalization/inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization, (8) we have recently cloned and characterized the anti-angiogenic fragment of TSP-1 (comprising of the regions of 3 type 1 repeats, where most of the peptides used in clinical settings have originated (16-17)) and shown its anti-angiogenic effect in vitro and anti-tumor effect . In this proposal, we will initially engineer mouse ipNSC with antiangiogenic, aaTSP-1 and test them for their vascular normalization potential in mouse models of glioma using a panel of both established cell lines (p53 wt and mutated) and invasive primary glioma cells from patients. The vascular normalization potential of on-site delivery of aaTSP-1 by ipNSC will be compared with systemic delivery of clinically approved known normalization agent, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor AZD2171 (8,18). We hypothesize that sustained on-site delivery of aaTSP-1 via ipNSC in the tumor micro-environment will overcome the lack of endogenous TSP-1 production in p53 mutant tumors and ultimately lead to prolonged vascular normalization and delay glioma growth in mouse glioma models. A close integration of: a) genetically engineered imaging markers; b) angiogenic probes; and c) bioluminescence imaging (BLI), intravital microscopy (IVM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and extensive neuropathology will allow us to assess fate and pharmacokinetics of ipNSC-aaTSP-1 and ultimately the aaTSP-1 mediated normalization process. To circumvent the delivery of cytotoxic agents through vasculature, we will further engineer ipNSC with regulatable bi-functional EGFR -TRAIL consisting of secretable version of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted nanobody (nb) (20) fused to tumor necrosis factor apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) (3,21). In an ongoing study in close collaboration with Henegouwen lab (Utrecht University, Netherlands), we have characterized EGFR -TRAIL and shown that it simultaneously targets cell proliferation and death pathways and induces apoptosis in both TRAIL resistant and sensitive cells glioma cells. The therapeutic effect of EGFR -TRAIL within the normalization window created by aaTSP-1 will be tested in both malignant and invasive glioma models. We hypothesize that regulatable release of EGFR -TRAIL from ipNSC will give us a direct measure of the cytotoxic effect of EGFRnb-TRAIL during aaTSP-1 mediated vessel normalization and lead to enhanced eradication of primary tumor mass. Furthermore, we hypothesize that therapeutic ipNSC will track micro-invasive tumor cells escaping the primary tumor mass. In an effort to simulate a clinical scenario of surgical resection of glioma, we will ultimately test the efficacy of therapeutic stem cells grown in biocompatible scaffolds in our recently developed glioma resection model . Once validated, these studies can be easily translated into clinics for different cancer types using patients own reprogrammed stem cells. In next 4-6 years, we envision a therapeutic modality in which at the time of brain tumor surgery, the main tumor mass will be removed and genetically engineered therapeutic cells will be introduced and allowed to target the remaining tumor cells and micro-invasive tumor deposits in the brain thus eliminating the risk of recurrence. This will have a major impact in saving the lives of many brain cancer patients.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020245\\n', 'year': '2010', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Bacterial species occupy ecological niches, in most cases forming together dynamic communities. The composition and interactions within these communities change over time and in response to environmental stimuli [1‐3]. Two species co‐inhabiting an ecological niche can compete for resources, cooperate to maximize resource utilization, divide the available resources between them, or combine competition, cooperation and division to various degrees. The relative fitness of a species in a certain ecological niche and, hence, the structure and composition of that particular community, will be to a large extent determined by the ecological strategies taken by all organisms in the community and by their interactions. The composition of bacterial communities is a major factor in human health. The microorganisms that live inside and on humans are estimated to outnumber human somatic and germ cells by a factor of ten. The genomes of these microbial symbionts provide functions that humans did not evolve on their own [4]. The microbiome of the human gut, for example, is composed of different lineages with a capacity to communicate with one another and with the host; it consumes, stores, and redistributes energy; and it mediates physiologically important chemical transformations [5]. Variations in the identity and abundance of species within this community affect its metabolic potential and hence have important medical implications. Obesity, for example, is associated with changes in the relative abundance of bacterial phyla [6]. Moreover, variations in the relative abundance of species in a community may shift the ecological balance of a given niche allowing, for example, the outburst of pathogens [7]. Such variations may also affect managed ecosystems such as bioreactors and agricultural fields [8,9]. Experimental and computational tools are now becoming available for the modeling of bacterial interactions, taking into account the identity of the interacting species and the available nutritional supplies.  Progress in the reconstruction of genome‐wide metabolic networks has led to the development of network based computational approaches for linking an organism with its biochemical habitat. Beyond predicting the biochemical habitat, such approaches are further exploited to study the interactions of microbes with other species thriving in similar habitats. Here we provide a short review of these innovative methods, some developed by us, for processing genomic information into environmental and ecological information. the consecutive nature of the reactions in metabolic pathways means that they can be modeled in the form of a network of enzymes and chemical transformations, and graph theory can be used to represent and understand metabolism [10]. The availability of many completely sequenced genomes together with several generic metabolic schemes [11] has led to the reconstruction of the metabolic networks of hundreds of species across the tree of life [12]. A recently published “seed algorithm” (developed as part of our previous work [13]) allows to use metabolic networks for predicting the set of metabolites an organism consumes from its surroundings. This algorithm takes as an input the metabolic network of a given species and looks for source components (i.e., components with no incoming edges); those components cannot be synthesized by the species and are hence exogenously acquired. This set of compounds reflects the metabolic environment of a species [14]. the seed algorithm allows the computation of species‐specific habitats. Aggregating the habitats computed for a set of species (for which a metabolic network is available) we previously obtained an ensemble of predicted natural habitats corresponding to hundreds of species across the tree of life. This ensemble represents the broadest ecological view provided by current data, allowing us to examine the viability of species across a wide‐range of ecological niches. Traditionally, flux‐balance approaches were used for estimating the ability of a species to grow on a given medium [15], but the underlying stoichiometric metabolic models are available for only a few selected species. Topological‐driven approaches (requiring only the network topological backbone and not a full‐blown stoichiometric model) have been recently shown to be sufficient for estimating growth by studying the ability of an organism to successfully expand its metabolic network so it produces a set of target metabolites that are essential for growth [16, 17]. Repeating this procedure for all species over all environments, we have provided the first large‐scale ecological model describing environmental characteristics from both a species and a habitat point of view [18]. From a species perspective, the model describes the range of environments it can inhabit. From an environmental perspective, it estimates for each environment the range of species it can contain. There are several indications testifying to the ecological plausibility of our model. First, the level of population of different environments is compatible with ecological knowledge: soil bacteria inhabit the most densely populated environments, and obligatory symbionts inhabit sparsely populated environments [19‐21] (Figure 1, Preliminary results). Second, the species‐specific level of environmental diversity is in strong agreement with acceptable, general measures of environmental diversity [20, 22]. This new ability to produce a genomic driven environmental model lays down a computational foundation for the study of a variety of aspects of the communal metabolic life. Notably, co‐inhabitation involves additional facets of interspecies interactions beyond competition, such as cooperation and symbiosis. In the following section we will discuss our vision for further improving this environmental model to describe more complex community structures, as well as promising applications of this extended model. Bacterial species have been long thought of as freeswimming planktonic organisms which live relatively independent unicellular lives [2]. Unlike this perception of bacterial life, a rapidly expanding body of research shows that microbes exhibit a variety of social behaviors involving complex systems of cooperation and labor division [2, 23]. Hence, relationships within a community of species sharing limited resources can be described in terms of competition and cooperation where the identity of the actual community members changes according to the pattern of the interactions. We aim to develop an eco‐metabolic model, describing communities according to both the characteristics of the environment and the characteristics of the inhabitants.  As a case‐study we will apply our modeling approach . We have chosen to focus on the gut because, first, metagenomic sampling provides a relatively comprehensive description of the nature of the species occupying this niche [5]. Second, tissue‐specific metabolic models for humans are now becoming available [24]; such models can provide information on the nature of compounds produced and consumed by the gut tissue, hence providing a description of the metabolic environment. Third, variations within the gut community are of considerable medical importance, making its modeling a high priority [6, 25‐27].", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Tel Aviv University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020196\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '449,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Recent\r\nyears have seen the growing use of models formalizing sensory perception, motor\r\ncontrol or behavioral strategies as probabilistic inference in elementary causal models.\r\nExcitable neural structures face similar problems than behaving organisms: they receive\r\nnoisy and ambiguous inputs, must accumulate evidence over time, combine unreliable\r\ncues, and compete with other neurons representing alternative interpretations of the\r\nsensory input. In my group, we apply such normative models, particularly Bayesian\r\nnetworks, in order to further our understanding of the function and dynamics of\r\nbiological neural networks. The originality of this research is that these models are applied at the level of\r\nmicroscopic structures such as single synapse, neurons or microcircuits, whose\r\ncomputations are strongly constrained by neural biophysics and dynamics. In particular,\r\nsingle spikes are our elementary unit of coding and meaning. This contrasts with the\r\ninfluential “rate models” encoding information by the mean activity of large neural\r\npopulations. Rate models account for the huge variability of cortical neural response but\r\nignore the dazzling complexity of biological neurons and networks, which makes them\r\npoorly predictive. Moreover, why would the most sophisticated and metabolically\r\nexpensive nervous system, the mammal brain, \"choose\" to compute with such unreliable\r\nunits at the expense of so many costly spikes? Our working hypotheses are two-folds. First, we suppose that single neurons and\r\nnetworks are specifically and precisely tuned to estimate sensory or motor variables as\r\nreliably as possible based on their unreliable inputs and prior experience. And second,\r\ntheir firing dynamics insures self-consistency, i.e. these estimates can be decoded from\r\noutput spike trains by postsynaptic integration. These two principles are enough to\r\nentirely constrain the structure, dynamics and plasticity of the corresponding spiking\r\nneural network. We were able to show recently that this purely functional approach\r\nconverges towards powerful descriptive models of spiking neurons, e.g. adaptive\r\nintegrate and fire neurons, chaotic balanced spiking networks and generalized linear\r\nmodels. This approach could profoundly change our views of neural coding and computation.\r\nThe modularity of Bayesian models ensures that neural structures implementing\r\nelementary causal models can be used as building blocks to construct hierarchical\r\nmodels underlying perception and behavior. In particular, we can directly predict the\r\nimpact of biophysical mechanisms (e.g. effects of acetylcholine on Ih currents) on normal\r\nor pathological behavior (e.g. focused attention, hallucinations). Moreover, sensory cells\r\nshould not be described by the traditional receptive field (RF), but by a “predictive field”\r\n(PF), i.e. the impact of their preferred stimulus on the sensory input. Indeed, sensory\r\nneurons should constantly reshape each other’s RF in order to solve ambiguities in the\r\nsensory scene.

Food webs are assembled from multiple sets of non-linear interactions between populations of organisms with widely differing birth and death rates; these create layered networks of interactions that are many steps removed from the single species or pair-wise inter-specific interactions that are the traditional domain of theoretical ecology. The level of complexity has only been made more challenging by the recent empirical realization that parasites and pathogens are ubiquitous features of all food-webs; their presence increases the species diversity by at least fifty percent and the density of links between species by a factor of around five (1-3). One would almost be prepared to abandon these problems as intractable, were it not for the fact that food-webs are the ultimate manifestation of the complex interactive systems whose emerging properties are fundamentally aligned with the persistence of natural ecosystems and the ecosystem services they supply to human health and economic welfare. There is a disconcerting urgency to our desire to understand how food-webs are assembled; most of the world's food-webs are being rapidly eroded and we need a better understanding of how the sequential loss of species through local extinction will lead to changes in food-web structure and declines in the rates of delivery of ecosystem services. This is particularly true in parts of the world where human health and economic welfare are intimately linked to services supplied by natural ecosystems and where pathogens and parasites are frequently shared between humans and a large reservoir of other host species. The recent renaissance in 'macroecology' has described many interesting relationships between body size and life history for a large diversity of animals and plants (4-6). Although we are beginning to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these 'allometric scalings' (both in ecology and biology in general), less has been done on the consequences of these scalings for the way in which food-webs are assembled. Similarly, considerably less has been done on scaling rules for species with parasitic life styles, most of the focus has been on free-living species. This is an important omission as best estimates suggest that around 40% of all known species are parasitic on the 60% of species that are free-living (1). Parasitic species are ubiquitous features of all natural ecosystems, they are often orders of magnitude more fecund than free-living species as their energy requirements are independent of their need to search for food; essentially they live in an environment where their host constantly supplies all their nutritional needs. However, most host species effectively resent this and devote considerable energy into developing an immunological response that recognizes the parasite as being foreign and then tries to kill or remove it. Does this cause the vital rates (birth and death rates) of parasites and pathogens to scale in different ways from those of free-living species? Or do parasitic species simply require their excess fecundity in order to ensure their offspring locate a viable host that they can infect and exploit in ways that maximize their fitness while ensuring the hosts they exploit live long enough to allow the parasite's offspring to colonize and exploit subsequent generations of hosts? Do any body size scaling underlie the dynamics and efficiency of the hosts immunological response? Ultimately the host's immune response has the dynamics of a predator-prey relationship with all the inherent constraints of reproductive rates and search and suppress times that characterize any exploiter-victim relationship. Although ecologists and evolutionary biologists have made significant advances in our understanding of the dynamics and coevolutionary biology of parasite-host relationships (7-9), most of these studies have focused on models, or experimental systems, that are constrained to examine a single species of pathogen and a single host species. Although some work has been done on pathogens that infect multiple hosts (10-12), and on communities of parasites that can coexist within a single host population (13, 14), there is a significant need to expand our understanding of the role that host and parasite diversity play in determining the dynamics of more complex and diverse host and parasite communities. In many ways parasites and pathogens are the 'dark matter' that lies beneath the more readily perceived and quantified consumer-resource relationships of free-living species (2, 3). Although each individual parasite is small in mass, its dynamics work on a much faster timescale than those of the free-living vertebrates, insects and plants that serve as hosts; this allows parasites and pathogens do evolve much faster and have significantly better potential to regulate the abundance of their hosts than can predators and herbivores whose population dynamics are constrained by digestion and the need to find mates and raise and defend young. Ultimately, we will not be able to make realistic models of food webs and realistically functioning natural ecosystems until we understand the dynamics of pathogens in realistically complex multi-host communities. Over the last ten years we have developed a framework that uses underlying allometric scalings between body-size and demographic rates to rescale mathematical models for a diversity of parasite-host relationships(10, 15, 16). We have also collaborated with a group of food-web ecologists to assemble data-sets for a number of natural food-webs that include extensive data on how parasite diversity and abundance is distributed in marine and terrestrial food-web networks (www:NCEAS Working Group on Parasites and Food-Webs). In this project we will build on our analytical initial work on scaling in host-parasite population dynamics and develop allometrically scaled models for complex food-webs that include parasites (and mutualists) as well as the more traditional predator-prey, plant-herbivore, and competitive interactions. Our work will proceed in a hierarchical manner, initially developing models for hosts that are parasitized by multiple species of parasites, and pathogens that can infect multiple species of hosts (both sequentially and simultaneously). Once the properties that allow coexistence (and coevolution) within theses systems have been elucidated for these 'community modules' of food web structure, we will combine them to examine how helminth (worm) parasites, and viral and bacterial pathogens, couple together layered networks of predator-prey (resource-consumer) relationships within large food-webs. Our ultimate goal is not only to understand the role that parasites and pathogens play in regulating the abundance of free-living species in natural ecosystems, but also to more finely delineate the roles that pathogens play in modifying rates of nutrient and energy flow through the complex ecological food-webs of natural ecosystems. Our work proceeds from the ironic, but empirically justifiable position, that a healthy ecosystem is one that contains a diverse and abundant parasitic fauna. Understanding the dynamics of processes that disrupt this balance and cause some parasitic species to become overabundant will provide both important insights into how natural ecosystems have evolved as complex adaptive systems. It will also provide insight into how natural ecosystems can be better conserved and managed in ways that both reduce disease risk to humans while also optimizing the benefits obtained from the ecosystem services they supply to the human economy.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Princeton University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020192\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '445,730', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This is a proposal to develop such a new approach based upon the convergence of two technologies, nanotechnology/materials science and stem cell biology, and their application to the treatment of brain tumors. Brain tumors are among the most devastating cancers. Primary brain tumors affect approximately 20,000 patients each year in the United States with about 12,500 deaths annually. Despite significant advances in surgical techniques, delivery of radiation, and chemotherapy, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a dire diagnosis, with a median survival of just over 14 months. Nearly 90% of patients suffer from tumor recurrence adjacent to the site of initial tumor resection despite radiographic evidence of disease remission following initial therapy. In part, tumor recurrence occurs because these tumors are not encapsulated and are thus not surgically curable; at the time of presentation, tumor cells have already migrated beyond the tumor mass and infiltrated surrounding brain. The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory posits that treatment failures reflect persistence of brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs) following therapy (1,2). CSCs are characterized by the property of self-renewal (ability to produce more CSCs), and the capacity to generate all the various cell types that comprise a tumor.

Much attention has been given to investigating these separate processes (although much more remains to be learned), and substantial attention has been given to the parallels between them. Less attention has been paid, however, to direct interactions between these two processes. In human societies, the spread of infectious diseases can have a profound impact on norms and beliefs, and thus on behaviors. For example, the HIV epidemic has dramatically changed attitudes about sexual relationships, and about safe sex, in many communities, with corresponding impacts on the spread of disease. Rising and falling levels of rabies incidence in sub-Saharan Africa trigger changes in governmental and societal behavior which are likely important to the dynamics of the disease. Flu epidemics (and, more recently, the SARS epidemic) have been correlated with reductions in interactions between individuals, and an increased use of face masks. Population responses to disease are not necessarily always helpful; for example, people fleeing from infectious diseases may be unwittingly helping to spread them. Understanding the interdependence between transmission of ideas and transmission of infectious diseases could point the way to more effective public-health strategies. The proposed project will combine mathematical modeling, data analysis, and sociological research to develop a basic and applied theory of the interactions between an infectious disease, and related beliefs and behaviors, spreading in a population. We will combine general and specific approaches, both constructing abstract models, and focusing on details of particular cases, in particular the case of male circumcision as an intervention against HIV. The WHO recently concluded that the research evidence in favor of male circumcision as a protective measure is \"compelling\", while simultaneously warning that it is crucial to ensure that public-health messages about partial protection and safe sex be attached to the circumcision initiative, and that the \"gender implications\" of directly protecting males but not females with this campaign must be addressed. We will use available HIV incidence and population-survey data to explore the interaction between the spread of HIV, the idea that male circumcision is protective against HIV, and the association of a wide variety of messages, norms, beliefs and attitudes with the idea of protective circumcision. An important factor in real diseases is the fact that ideas themselves travel in groups, and these groupings are constantly changing. Public-health officials often strive, in effect, to package medical or public-health technologies with messages that they believe are helpful. Thus, people treated for HIV may be given information about safe sex, or those treated for cholera may be given information about safe drinking water. But ideas associate themselves in other ways, as well. So, for example, a community of individuals under treatment for a sexually transmitted disease might develop a norm of practicing less safe sex, based on the belief that the treatment protects their partners. Which attitudes, beliefs and behaviors spread along with medical and public health interventions will be affected by how infectious diseases spread, and may in turn have dramatic effects on the spread of those diseases. It is also worth noting that information about the prevalence and severity of an infectious disease, like information about prevention and treatment, is largely mediated through cultural messages. In most cases, individuals do not form their opinions of disease risk primarily through direct experience. People may think that a disease is widespread when it is rare, or vice versa; for example, many people are surprised to learn that rabies causes more human deaths each year than dengue fever. A vivid case in point is that of influenza. The case that there is objectively more reason to worry about pandemic flu now than there was 10 years ago is mixed at best, but there is no question that society is more worried, and that many behaviors have changed as a result. The proposed research will develop a theoretical framework for studying interactions between the spread of: infectious diseases; technologies which treat disease or prevent its transmission; and norms and behaviors affecting the spread of disease. We will address general questions about how such phenomena are expected to interact, and also specific case studies, using publicly available data, focusing in particular on the case of HIV and circumcision. Crucially, we will work to link our general insights to our specific findings, and vice versa. At the broadest level, we will look at abstract models of interacting spread on a \"network\" -- a population linked by connections, representing potential transmission either of information or disease. Much has already been learned about how diseases spread on networks, and about how to abstract key, measurable parameters from the huge amount of detail needed to completely specify a network. Typically, it is at least necessary to measure the mean and variance of individuals' numbers of connections, as well as a measure of how clustered connections are. Increasingly, it is becoming evident that in the network are important for disease spread; thus it may also be necessary to have a parameter that measures the rate of this change. We will work to solidify understanding of simple principles of how diseases spread on networks, and then to expand them to include interactions between disease spread and changes in behavior. Simple models have already explored feedbacks between disease prevalence and behavior changes, but as far as we know this has been done mostly in a phenomenological fashion, not explicitly considering the spread of messages, and mostly without taking network structure into account. At a more concrete level, we will investigate and characterize available data from Africa about HIV incidence, traditional and changing patterns of male circumcision, and surveys about sexual behavior, attitudes and beliefs. We will investigate what factors determine how well messages (both accurate and inaccurate) spread, and how effective these messages are at changing behavior. Unfortunately, most existing sexual behavior surveys provide limited ability to separate attitudes from behavior. We will therefore supplement available survey data with our own, relatively small-scale surveys in Africa to begin to disentangle issues that cannot be resolved from the broader surveys. We will work to bridge the abstract and the concrete, both by using insights from modeling to guide data analysis (and, eventually, data collection), and by using results from data analysis to construct more specific models, which we will analyze in parallel with the simpler basic models. For example, we will expand our basic model to account for the fact that the sexual-contact network on which HIV spreads is different from the communication network on which information spreads (although they encompass the same group of people). We will further investigate the effects of \"directional\" interactions -- i.e., a doctor or journalist may transmit information to many people, but receive information from only a few. Finally, we will work to synthesize our findings into specific hypotheses and suggestions about public-health messages: what sorts of messages, and what methods of transmission, will be most effective at convincing people to adopt behaviors that will protect themselves and others against the spread of infectious diseases? In a practical sense, control of infectious diseases depends to a large extent on effectively communicating messages that change people's behavior, both in terms of reducing transmission, and seeking appropriate prevention and treatment. The proposed investigation of how messages, behaviors and infectious diseases interact promises important findings about network dynamics, as well as applications to public health in general, and to controlling HIV in particular.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'McMaster University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020198\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '448,671', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

From the emergence of social norms, to the adoption of technological innovations, to the growth of social movements, social networks are the pathways along which these \"social contagions\" propagate. Studies of diffusion dynamics have demonstrated that the structure (or topology) of a social network can have significant consequences for the patterns of collective behavior that emerge. Over the last thirty-five years, questions about how the structure of social networks affects the dynamics of diffusion have been of increasing interest to social scientists. Granovetter's (1973) \"Strength of Weak Ties\" study, ushered in an era of unprecedented interest in how network dynamics, and in particular diffusion on networks, affect every aspect of social life, from the organization of social movements, to school segregation, to immigration. Granovetter's study showed that \"weak ties\" between casual acquaintances can be much more effective at promoting diffusion and social integration than \"strong ties\" between close friends. This is because although casual friendships are relationally weak, they are more likely to be formed between socially distant actors with few network \"neighbors\" in common. These \"long ties\" between otherwise distant nodes provide access to new information and greatly increase the rate at which information propagates, despite the relational weakness of the tie as a conduit. More recently, the explosion of network science across disciplines such as physics, biology, and computer science has produced many important advances for understanding how the structure of social networks affect the dynamics of diffusion. The full impact of Granovetter's original insight was not realized until Watts and Strogatz's (1998) \"small world\" model demonstrated that bridge ties connecting otherwise distant nodes can dramatically increase the rate of propagation across a network by creating \"shortcuts\" between remote clusters. Further, these results showed that surprisingly few \"long ties\" are needed to give even highly clustered networks the \"degrees of separation\" characteristic of a \"small world.\" This model of network dynamics has had a tremendous impact on fields as diverse as computer science, physics, epidemiology, sociology, and political science. Yet, despite the remarkable progress of networks research across the disciplines, there may be serious risks in generalizing results from the physical, biological, and even information sciences to the diffusion of collective behaviors. This is because the most important theoretical advances in the study of cascades on large networks (including Granovetter's original study) have been made for simple contagions, such the spread of disease or information, in which a single activated node is sufficient to trigger the activation of its neighbors. However propagation dynamics of social behaviors are typically complex, which means that node activation requires simultaneous exposure to multiple activated neighbors. Social behaviors have the important property that a bystander's probability of joining an activity increases with the level of local participation by her neighbors. Unlike disease or information, one neighbor acting alone is rarely sufficient to pass the contagion to another. This distinctive property of behavioral cascades led us to question whether the effects of small worlds and weak ties can be generalized from simple contagions like disease and information to the complex contagions that characterize the spread of collective behaviors. In a series of computational studies, our research led to a startling discovery about the spread of collective behaviors: If the credibility of information or the willingness to adopt an innovation depends on receiving independent confirmation from multiple sources, increasing the fraction of \"weak ties\" or \"bridges\" in a social network may not only fail to increase the rate of diffusion, but can even preclude diffusion entirely. This surprising reversal of the small world principle suggests that across a wide variety of conditions there may be significant differences in the diffusion dynamics of simple contagions (such as information and disease) versus complex contagions (such as norms and collective behavior). This has striking implications for any kind of social, commercial, or health intervention designed to promote the spread of a collective behavior. For example, casual contact sexual networks have been shown to have small world and \"scale-free\" properties, which allow for the rapid diffusion of simple contagions such as HIV/AIDS. Public health officials interested in promoting safe sex behavior have a natural interest in exploiting these causal contact networks since the long ties that accelerate the spread of disease are also the channels along which preventative information can quickly propagate. However, where public health innovations contravene existing social norms, health reform is likely to require social reinforcement, not simply access to information. While word of mouth transmission of new ideas may travel as quickly as the spread of a disease, the information may have little effect in changing entrenched yet risky behaviors without the social reinforcement provided by additional contacts. Thus, efforts to change behavioral norms through peer influence may reach greater numbers with greater speed by targeting networks with seemingly less desirable characteristics for diffusion (e.g., tightly-knit residential networks) rather than the complex networks through which disease is more rapidly transmitted. These implications highlight the need for more careful research on the effects of network topology on the spread of social contagions. They also highlight a growing disparity between the increasingly powerful tools for developing theoretical insights at the intersection of social science and complex systems, and the empirical resources for testing and evaluating these insights. The empirical problem of collecting social network data is a difficult one. But, for the study of diffusion dynamics, this problem is compounded by the need for dynamic, longitudinal data with extremely fine-grained resolution, without which we cannot track the flow of a behavior through a social network. Further, we neither have systematic data on individual thresholds for adoption based on social network contacts, nor on how social connectedness affects the pathways of diffusion. All of which makes the empirical relevance of theoretical research on social networks profoundly uncertain: without a means for testing the implications of theoretical models, we have no method for arbitrating between them, or for developing cumulative research on the diffusion dynamics of social behavior. Traditional methods of data collection in the social sciences are simply not up to the task. This proposal focuses on the development of new experimental methods for studying how the structure of a population affects the diffusion dynamics of collective behaviors across it. This research will pioneer the use of an Internet-based experimental design for studying the diffusion of behavior through on-line communities. A pilot study for this proposal, which was developed to test the effectiveness of this approach, has proved to be remarkably successful at generating social cascade dynamics. This experimental design will also generate data on 1) how thresholds for adoption interact with network topology, and 2) how the timing effects of signaling (i.e., how long on average between signals people wait before responding) interact with actors' positions in the social network. While these quantities can significantly affect the dynamics of diffusion, current network models make simplifying assumptions about them because there previously has not been a method for reliably collecting these data. The pilot study intentionally has a very simple design, however its success opens the door to a host of interesting research questions that previously could not be studied in an experimental setting. For example, the effects of status, power, affective strength of ties, assortative interaction (i.e., homophily), and tie valence on the dynamics of social diffusion have all been very difficult to approach through a purely theoretical lens because of the lack of empirical data on how these variables behave and interact in the context of network diffusion. Similarly, these factors have been difficult to disentangle with available empirical instruments because of their frequent co-occurrence, leading to speculations about their respective roles in the process of diffusion without any systematic means for determining their independent effects. The method of experimental research that we propose pursuing will allow us to disambiguate these factors so that we can isolate and identify the effects of different structural properties of social networks on the dynamics of emergent social behavior. Our goal with this project is not just to test existing theory, but to develop new theoretical models based on the dynamic data we collect. Thus, we will use the findings from our network experiments to develop new computational and analytical models of the spread of collective behavior. While there is a long tradition of social dynamics research, the study of complex social dynamics is still in its infancy - we know very little about complex contagions, or about how well our general theoretical models map onto various domains of application. The proposed research leverages the new medium of on-line communities to develop a novel approach for empirically testing theoretical models of social diffusion, thereby increasing the power and applicability of research on the dynamics of collective behavior.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020197\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '259,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Prediction plays a\r\nprominent role in models of seemingly disparate cognitive functions such as perception, motor control, and language processing. We often only become aware of these predictions when they are violated. For example, when opening the door of our house does not result in the expected auditory squeak, we are surprised, whereas if we hear the expected squeak at the expected time, we fail to notice it. Sensory predictions can originate from our own actions, but they can also by generated by probabilistic associations with other sensory events that have been learned from previous experience. Although there is ample behavioral evidence for the predictive nature of perception, the incorporation of prior knowledge in the neural processes underlying perception is still poorly understood. My long-term research goals are to understand how prior expectations (‘priors’) about the sensory world influence the neural computations that give rise to perception. In my lab, we view perception as a process of probabilistic inference, in which bottom-up input is continuously compared with top-down expectations. Perception arises from this recurrent interaction as the brain settles on a particular\r\ninterpretation of the world. My lab uses a variety of approaches (neuroimaging, electrophysiology, brain stimulation and psychophysics) to tackle this problem of predictive perception at several levels of granularity - from activity in sensory populations to neural systems and behavior. Moreover, we employ sophisticated population analysis methods to obtain feature-specific responses from neural recordings, and aim to link empirical data to computational models of perceptual inference. In doing so, we have gained novel insights into priors change sensory neural computations and behavior. We recently showed that priors can lead to a reduction of sensory activity, but a concurrent increase in informational content in the sensory response. This suggests that priors may sharpen the sensory representation, and it is an important step towards understanding the functional significance of activity modulations induced by prior expectation. Secondly, we are studying the link between prior expectation and the closely related concept of selective attention. Whereas these concepts have been treated as interchangeable by many scholars, we have begun to provide empirical evidence for their distinct computational roles and neural implementations, as well as their synergistic interaction. My lab will take this research line forward by connecting current data to both more fine-grained computations within cortical circuits (‘zooming in’) and a network investigation of the communication between sensory regions with memory- and decision-related structures during the acquisition of prior expectations (‘zooming out’). Connecting these levels of description will allow for a more complete linkage between computational models of predictive perception, sensory neural data and system behavior. This will provide a deeper account of the predictive nature of the neural computations that implement human perception, and may help to build models that can account for\r\nthe deficits that arise when these computations go wrong, such as in autism and schizophrenia.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Radboud University Nijmegen', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020373\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This growth has been fostered by waning communication costs and increased global interdependence that have greatly strengthened the connectivity of local and global processes in both top-down (e.g., global manufacturing firms seek out low labor cost regions of the world) and bottom-up (e.g., natural locations attract households and spur economic growth) directions. The implication is that 21st century urban systems are even more likely to exhibit the characteristics of complex, nonlinear systems than their predecessors. This raises important policy questions about the management of these systems. Increased interactions can reduce the robustness of urban and natural systems by making them more susceptible to external shocks. Interactions can also lead to increased diversity of people or economic activity within a region, which can enhance robustness.

The most common tumor of the brain is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM); accounting for approximately 25% of brain tumors. GBM is amongst the most lethal and difficult forms of cancer to treat with a median survival of 40-60 weeks from diagnosis, a dismally poor figure that has remained relatively unchanged for decades. All cells contain a highly complex network of molecules, which in normal cells is tightly regulated and controlled. In cancer cells this regulation is lost through a plethora of mechanism leading to uncontrolled cell growth and increased cell survival. Targeted therapies are a new paradigm for the treatment of cancer because they specifically target key molecules in this complex network that contribute to the growth and survival of tumor cells. Therapies can target molecules such as proteins on the cell surface (i.e. receptors) that transmit growth and/or survival signals originating from outside cell to the inside of the cell. Alternatively, they may be directed protein molecules inside the cell (i.e. signalling molecules) that are responsible for converting the message from the different receptors on the cell surface into an appropriate response (e.g. move, divide etc). Targeted therapies are more specific for cancer cells and therefore have less side effects than current chemotherapy agents. Currently there are 2 major classes of targeted therapeutics, the first of which is monoclonal antibodies (mAb's). Antibodies are a major component of the body's immune system that bind to foreign substances such as viruses. Once bound, antibodies can activate other parts of the immune system, which help destroy the foreign substance. Each antibody is unique, hence the term monoclonal, and can only bind a single target. Analogous to the situation, it is possible to generate and manufacture in culture, mAb's that bind specifically to receptors on the surface of cancer cells. Once bound the antibody can \"switch-off the receptor causing a slowing of tumor growth, or activate the immune system leading to tumor damage or even destruction. The second major class of targeted therapeutics are small chemical-based inhibitors (tyrosine kinase inhibitors or TKI's), which have the advantage of being able to target both receptors on the cell surface and signalling molecules found inside the cell. They can also be given orally while antibodies have to be delivered intravenously. Unlike antibodies they cannot activate the immune system and tend to have greater side-effects because they often bind additional targets; antibodies are exquisitely specific for their target. In some instances the promiscuous nature of TKI's is considered an advantage as one molecule may potentially block the function of several signalling molecules simultaneously. Like an antibody, once bound the TKI can \"switch-off the signalling molecule causing an anti-tumor effect by reducing tumor cell growth or stimulating tumor cell death. A small number of cancers are driven by the inappropriate activation of a single signalling pathway and therefore are susceptible to a single targeted therapy. However, most solid tumors such as GBM contain a range of inappropriately activated signalling molecules, all of which may contribute to its cancerous growth. Inappropriate activation can be caused mutation or the excessive presence of a particular signalling molecule. Thus, a single targeted therapy is unlikely be effective in the majority of GBM, especially long term, as other signalling molecules \"step-in\" to fill the gap created by blocking a single molecule. The complex network of signalling molecules inside a cancer cell can be compared to the road map of a modern city. There are freeways which represent fundamental \"pathways\" that numerous signalling molecules feed into at different points. While different cancers, and even subtypes of the same cancer, will have their own set of freeways, I hypothesize that there will be some freeways essential to a particular cancer type such as GBM. Extending the analogy, these freeways are fed by a complex network of major roads which represent important signalling networks. These major roads will vary even between GBM patients, however some of them will occur in reasonable percentage of GBM's, and more importantly, some will be critical to the growth and/or survival of the cancer cells. Finally, there will be many small lane ways and one way streets that interact with the major roads. These smaller roads will vary dramatically between different GBM's and their function will be less critical. I would suggest that there are currently 3 well defined freeways (i.e. fundamental signalling pathways) identified that are critical to the development of GBM. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) pathway appears to be one of the most important signalling pathways in the development of GBM, therefore this freeway is a key one to target. Recent evidence suggests that activation of STAT3 pathway also appears to have a fundamental role in GBM progression and can be considered another freeway. Finally, inactivation of the p53 pathway represents another freeway important in GBM but is not been considered in this current proposal. All 3 freeways can be activated by a variety of mechanisms. A number of other freeways will probably become apparent in GBM over the next few years, but their number should be restricted. This analogy of freeways and roads leads to a number of important questions. How do you efficiently block a freeway in a GBM cell? How many freeways do you have to block to prevent the growth/survival of GBM tumors? Do you have to concurrently block some of the major roads to efficiently inhibit tumor growth and survival? The overall aim of this grant is to address these key issues with respect to GBM. Freeways could be blocked by targeting their entrances (i.e. receptors on the cell surface) or blocking key signalling molecules further along the freeway. The strategy my laboratory has chosen is to block freeways at their entrance by targeting receptors with antibodies. We have chosen the antibody approach for the reasons discussed above; exquisitely specific and low toxicity. For example, we have developed an antibody that blocks the function of a receptor known as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Activation of this receptor in GBM leads to the subsequent activation of the PI3-K freeway. We believe that targeting signalling pathways at their beginning is the most efficient method of closing them down. Shutting down of freeways half way along allows some of the traffic to escape into major roads and is therefore a less efficient approach. The difficulty with our approach is that there are multiple entrances to each freeway. Therefore, you need to develop multiple blocking antibodies to the different receptors (i.e. entrances) involved in activating a particular freeway. We already have two blocking antibodies to one receptor (i.e. EGFR) that should help close down the PI3-K freeway. We also have access to an antibody that blocks a molecule known as c-met; another receptor that activates the PI3-K freeway. We plan to determine if the strategy of targeting both these receptors is sufficient to inhibit the PI3-K freeway and if the inhibition of this one freeway is adequate to robustly prevent the growth of multiple GBM models. We are currently developing antibodies capable of blocking molecules that responsible for activating the STAT3 freeway. We will then combine antibodies to both these freeways to determine what effect blocking two signalling freeways has on GBM growth and survival. Recent work suggests that a molecule known as src forms a major road in GBM signalling. Because src is inside the cell it cannot be targeted with antibodies. However, there is a TKI (Dasatinib) that inhibits the function of src, currently being tested in a variety of cancer patients. We will use Dasatinib to determine if blocking a major road in combination with freeways leads to enhanced anti-tumor response. Targeted therapies are an important new class of evolving agents for the treatment of cancer including GBM. It is clear that a single target therapy will not be sufficient to cure GBM. The studies in this proposal are designed to understand how many targeted therapies are required to efficiently inhibit tumor growth, and more importantly, what type of combinations work the most efficiently. Long term it is hoped that these studies will lead to more effective treatment, and even cure, of GBM; an aggressive, almost universally fatal, form of cancer.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Monash Institute of Medical Research', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020173\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '386,500', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

While components of these networks have been identified, a complete description of cellular regulation remains the central goal of modern systems biology research. Advances in high–throughput (HT) assays, which enable simultaneous measurement of millions of molecular markers per sample on a genome–wide  scale, now provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate  these systems in extremely fine detail. The enormous wealth of HT data brings with it significant analytical challenges.  Examining each assayed gene independently (as is often done in HT studies) will fail to capture crucial –level effects, yet the temptation to construct models that  are as comprehensively  detailed as our measurements  will  lead to de-scriptions that—like Borges’ fictional map∗—are  so elaborate as to be useless.  To fully realize the potential of genome–wide studies, it is necessary to develop minimal models that articulate the crucial determinants of biological function. My group’s research, broadly described  as computational systems biology, includes the development of novel statistical methods for the analysis of HT data as well as simulation studies of biophysical dynamics, with the goal of modeling the processes that lead to the emergence of complex phenotypes. The proposed work is organized around three broad aims: to develop novel computational techniques to infer and analyze regulatory networks from high-dimensional HT data; to make testable predictions about the network dynamics  based on their structural properties; and to investigate the crucial interactions within those networks through dynamical simulation.  In collaboration with  experimentalists and clinical investigators, we will  apply these models to investigate the mechanisms underlying malignant transformation, myelodysplastic syndromes, and the antiviral response. A key innovation of our approach is the development of a novel graph–theoretic framework to summarize HT data in the context of biological network topology. Because our methods do not rely upon single–gene association statistics, they are able to articulate bulk pathway–level differences even when samples are molecularly diverse or exhibit nonlinear patterns of gene expression.  More importantly, our approach characterizes the connectivity of signaling networks in a manner that is directly related to the network’s properties. This enables us to make testable predictions about the responsiveness and robustness of regulatory networks using based on static “snapshot” data obtained in HT assays.  In contrast to existing systems analysis techniques, which only yield lists of significant pathways, our approach has the potential to not only enumerate systems differ, but also indicate how those systems will behave when perturbed. This feature enables us to go beyond “stamp collections” of significant genes/pathways and make predictions about pathway behavior that can be validated using simulation studies or experimental modulation.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Northwestern University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020394\\n', 'year': '2014', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

A cathedral is a pile of stones, a sweater is knit from yarn, and a jellyfish is a collection  of cells. Such metamaterials are inherently tunable based on how the building  blocks are assembled. Some properties are inherited from the building  blocks – yarn is more flexible  than stone – and other properties arise cooperatively.  Although  made of metal, chainmail  nonetheless drapes like a sweater: the flexibility arises from the rotation of links. If you removed links from the chainmail or stones from the cathedral one by one, you would cross a threshold  beyond which you had no coherent structure: cooperativity has its limits. Thus, the properties of the building  blocks, the interactions between them, and their geometric configurations all play a role in determining the properties of metamaterials. The network of connections between the blocks not only controls whether the material is stable, but also the flow of energy, fluids, or electricity. A great boon in design would arise from having tools to create materials with an optimal mix of rigidity/flexibility, or a particular connectivity  of pores.  Ultra- light building materials would optimize rigidity, fabrics for smart clothing would optimize drape without loss of electrically conducting paths, and energy-harvesting nanomaterials would tune the vibrational modes. However, design principles permitting scalability from the choice of building blocks to the full behavior of the system remain poorly understood. Classically, descriptions have focused on average or maximum  behavior, rather than on exploiting structures at multiple length scales. Naturally-occurring  and self-organized systems illustrate  an alternative approach: exploiting properties which exist on many scales.  The hierarchy of connections which exist in social, neurological, ecological, epidemiological,  and economic networks provide efficiency and robustness to the system as a whole. This proposal aims to develop  network  science tools as a means to advance our understanding of complex metamaterials. To make this connection, we write a mathematical representation of a material  as a network. The building blocks are the nodes of the network,  and the specific configuration  provides the connections between those nodes. Such representations allow for sophisticated analyses which partition the material into connected “communities”  and pinpoint key nodes/edges which control  the behavior of the system. Because networks associated with materials are spatially-embedded (building  blocks connect to neighboring blocks), their properties provide an interesting contrast with those studied in social/biological contexts. My group is poised to make advances by combining expertise in granular materials, network theory, and nonlinear dynamics.  This proposal describes controlled  laboratory measurements mapping out the network of connections within real materials, with the aim of developing new network tools to predict the complex, cooperative response. Our experiments will focus on granular materials (optical  measurements provide the contact forces) and 3D printed foams with the contact network known in advance.

By the time we\r\nreach the age of 70, almost all of us will experience general anesthesia at least once. Although \r\ngeneral anesthesia is reversible, there is accumulating evidence that it causes post-operative \r\ncognitive dysfunction in elderly patients that can persist for months, or even years. As our\r\npopulation gets older, the number of elderly patients requiring surgery will continue to increase. \r\nTherefore post-operative cognitive dysfunction is fast becoming a major public health problem \r\nwith no available treatment. In clinical practice, general anesthesia is rapidly induced and maintained by the active \r\nadministration of intravenous or inhalational drugs. In contrast, emergence from general \r\nanesthesia is a slow process dictated by the pharmacokinetics of anesthetic drug clearance, a \r\nprocess we term \"passive emergence.\" Passive emergence from general anesthesia is \r\nhazardous because at low doses, general anesthetics cause paradoxical excitation of the \r\ncentral nervous system leading to complications such as laryngospasm, hemodynamic \r\ninstability, and delirium. My laboratory studies the neural mechanisms of emergence and cognitive recovery from \r\ngeneral anesthesia, and we discovered that methylphenidate (Ritalin) induces active emergence \r\nfrom continuous general anesthesia in rodents. We term this active emergence process \r\n\"reanimation\" to distinguish it from the passive emergence process currently employed in clinical \r\npractice. Our most recent work demonstrates that stimulation of dopamine neurons in the \r\nventral tegmental area induces reanimation from general anesthesia, suggesting that \r\nmethylphenidate and dopamine agonists induce reanimation by activating a dopaminergic\r\narousal pathway projecting from this area of the midbrain. In addition to brainstem activation, \r\nmethylphenidate also induces evidence of cortical activation and cognitive recovery. Over the next four years, I will establish a clinical research program at Massachusetts \r\nGeneral Hospital that tests the efficacy of methylphenidate for reanimation and cognitive \r\nrecovery in anesthetized humans. Emergence from general anesthesia provides a unique \r\nwindow into the process of recovery from a comatose state to a conscious state, and our work \r\nwill provide fundamental insights into how human cognition is restored after general anesthesia. \r\nConsidering that almost all of us will have general anesthesia at some point in our lives, \r\ncognitive recovery from general anesthesia is an important research topic that needs to be \r\ninvestigated. Understanding the neural mechanisms that drive this process will lead us to new \r\ntreatments for clinical problems with no available therapy, such as post-operative delirium and \r\ncognitive dysfunction.

The pedagogical philosophy first \nintroduced by Ibn Tufayl emphasizes our human capacities for curiosity, selective information \nsampling, and inference, ideas which continue to reverberate through contemporary educational \npolicy and psychological research. My research explores essentially the same topic viewed \nalmost 900 years later through the lens of another medieval Islamic invention, the algorithm. In particular, I am interested in how people bootstrap understanding from their self-guided \ninteractions with the world around them. For example, how are we so good at figuring out how \nsomething works by tinkering with it? How do we formulate questions with the goal of gaining \nknowledge and reducing our uncertainty? How do our choices to gather information affect our \nmemory or conceptual knowledge? Such questions strike at the heart of what makes us such an \nadaptable and intelligent species. A central goal of my work is to convert these broad questions about human learning into precise \nscientific hypotheses. As a former engineer, I have always drawn inspiration from the famous \nRichard Feynman quote \"What I cannot create, I do not understand. \" This idea—that \nunderstanding can be expressed by building an equivalent model system—is central to both my \nresearch and teaching philosophies.

While \nmachine learning researchers often look to the capacities of human intelligence for inspiration, a \npremise in my work is that this dialog can also run productively in the other direction. By \ncomparing the behavior of people to intelligent algorithms that can plan, reason, decide, and \nlearn in complex domains, we can better understand what makes humans so uniquely smart.

All humans use \r\nrepresentational systems, but individuals differ radically in their degree of sophistication in using them—for \r\nexample, whereas some people deploy mathematics to design bridges and compute interplanetary distances, \r\nothers struggle to compute a restaurant tip. Where do these individual differences come from, and how can \r\ndeficits in such abilities be addressed so as to give all people access to more powerful cognitive tools? In my work I test the premise that studying human mathematical thinking will yield answers to both of \r\nthese questions. I have found that individual differences in people’s math abilities are linked to individual \r\ndifferences in the precision of an evolutionarily ancient Approximate Number System (ANS). That is, the same \r\nprimitive conceptual system that allows fish to estimate the number of conspecifics in a nearby shoal, and rats \r\nto estimate the number of key presses in a laboratory cage, also supports humans’ ability to reason \r\nmathematically using formal systems for expressing quantity. Further, I have recently found that improving \r\nchildren’s ANS also improves their school math performance. Surprisingly, nothing is yet known about the origins of these individual differences in approximate \r\nnumber representations—neither their beginning in our genes nor their responsivity to accumulated \r\nexperiences.

First, \r\nquantifying numerical approximation abilities among people of differing degrees of biological relatedness will \r\nreveal the extent to which individual differences in the Approximate Number System are heritable. Second, \r\nlarge-scale interventions designed to improve children’s non-symbolic numerical intuitions will reveal the extent \r\nto which the ANS is malleable, and can be sharpened with experience, in different populations with very \r\ndifferent histories of formal educational exposure. These then are two windows onto a continuum–they can \r\nallow us to characterize the ways in which genes and experience intertwine to give rise to different \r\nmathematical abilities.

This is true of every spoken language that has been described and in multiple dimensions: the combination of sounds to create words (phonology), the combination of morphemes  single meaningful units  to create complex words and phrases (morphology), and the combination of words into sentences (syntax). Linguists have taken these behavioral properties of human language as evidence for a set of abstract cognitive representations and principles present in the mind of every speaker. Representations include an inventory of phonemes (contrastive sounds), a set of lexical items, while principles include those governing the possible and impossible combinations of sounds, and the combination of words into sentences. Languages differ from each other because these representations can differ: Each language has its own inventory of phonemes, its own lexical items, and its own organizing principles. Restrictions found in the phonology include: phoneme inventories tend to be spread out in articulatory and acoustic space, single lexical items tend to have upper and lower bounds on their size, and certain sequences of sounds are permissible while others are not. Our interest lies in the representation of the phonological component: the sounds and the restrictions on their combination. Phonology is unique among analytical levels of language in that restrictions on sound combination are local: languages obey restrictions against neighbouring segments, and not against the co-occurrence of segments with lots of intervening material. For example, many languages forbid a sequence like np (preferring mp), but no language is known to have a rule forbidding n and p to occur in the same word when many other sounds separate them. This property of phonology is known as Adjacency. The focus of our study is harmony, a phenomenon in which sound restrictions apparently hold over segments that are not quite adjacent. In a harmonic system, certain sounds within a word must share a certain feature. For example, some languages (like Hungarian) require all vowels within words to share a polar value of tongue backing. Intervening sounds may intervene, so consonants interspersed within the word need not agree with this polar value. Such intervening but unaffected sounds are called transparent. Transparent segments are important because they illustrate a potential abstraction in the organization of sounds into words. The phenomenon of adjacency suggests that phonological restrictions have articulatory/motor reasons for their existence, yet transparent segments suggest otherwise. Phonological theory accounts for transparent segments by construing harmonic sounds as adjacent at an abstract level. However, there is more to be known about transparent segments. Linguists infer the mental representation of components and rules from the behavior of spoken language. In fact, there is an additional step of inference that normally goes unquestioned: We infer articulatory behavior from acoustic signals, and in turn infer representations from those inferences. Harmony and Transparency are articulatory phenomena  yet the current evidence for them is only acoustic in nature. Our goal is to determine whether the true articulation of transparent segments matches what is inferred from the acoustic signal. It may be that transparent segments are actually not impervious to the harmonic feature, and rather that the presence of the feature goes undetected by speakers and by linguists. The only way to detect such a mismatch is to plot the movement of articulators inside the mouth instead of simply inferring from the acoustic signal. Our proposal is to use ultrasound technology to accomplish this. Other alternatives for obtaining such imagery are less feasible: X-ray filming is dangerous, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot capture moving images. We will apply our experimental procedure to a number of languages with harmonic systems, using ultrasound to capture images inside the mouths of native speakers. This allows for a straightforward determination about the articulatory nature of transparent sounds. Knowing what the harmonic feature is, we can test to see if the gesture is present in transparent sounds. There are two possible outcomes for any individual case: Both results are interesting. The first confirms the traditional view that transparent segments are evidence that Adjacency is an abstract property of the pre-motor cognitive representations of spoken words. The second provides evidence that transparency is a perceptual trick, in that apparent transparent segments are interpreted by the perceptual faculty of the listener as being identical in harmonic and non-harmonic environments, despite having distinct articulations. In short, we answer the question, does perception reconstruct mental representation of articulation or it? Our research questions can be answered with an innovative but rigid experimental design, using objective measurements that are readily compared within and across subjects. The procedure adds a new dimension of measurement to the domain of language description We foresee impacts of our research on linguistics, cognitive science, and beyond. We already know that mental representation of language uses abstract constructs: no speaker represents a spoken utterance simply as a linear sequence of sounds. With the special case of transparency in harmony, we can locate an instance of such abstractness with confidence, either in the mind of speaker or the mind of the listener. This result will solidify our understanding of the connection between cognitive representations and their physical manifestation. In addition, our procedure is an innovative application of existing technology; the use of ultrasound in linguistics is in its infancy yet shows great promise for answering long-standing questions. Finally, our research is important for the languages we intend to study, some of which are underdocumented and endangered. Solid generalizations about language must be based on a diverse sample of languages. This diversity diminishes when the last speaker of a language dies. To the extent that speakers of dying languages will work with us, our project will contribute to their maintenance by documenting the precise articulations while speakers remain alive.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Arizona', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020045\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '93,770', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Their place of entry in the cortex is the primary visual area (V1). Because visual stimuli have to pass through V1 to reach higher cortical areas, and because responses in V1 are already seen to reflect attributes of the perceptual experience of the visual stimuli, V1 is considered a key region in the processing of visual information. The most common way to study responses of V1 neurons is by showing simple stimuli such as bars and crosses. Using these stimuli, it has been possible to characterize the main features that make V1 neurons fire, by describing a neurons receptive field, the region of visual space where light elicits responses. The classical model of V1 neurons is that they perform weighted sums (and subtractions) of the stimulus intensities, with weights given by the receptive field. Research in the last 15 years, however, has revealed a number of phenomena that are not explained by receptive fields alone. For example, V1 neurons receive one kind of suppression from a visual region roughly overlapping with the receptive field, and another kind of suppression from a visual region extending beyond the confines of the receptive field. Both forms of suppression can be described as divisive: suppressing stimuli divide the effective strength of stimuli seen by the neuron. The opposite effects appear when neuronal responses are enhanced by visual attention, suggesting that suppression and attention might engage the same mechanisms, one to obtain division, the other to obtain multiplication. A new generation of models shows great promise in explaining these effects. In addition to a receptive field, these models include a suppressive field with distinct visual preferences. The suppressive field estimates overall local strength of the stimulus, and divides the output of the receptive field. While they show great promise, however, these divisive models have not yet fully replaced the classical models based on the receptive field as the standard employed by the community. What is not known is whether a single divisive model can explain all the phenomena that have been demonstrated to challenge the classical model. Moreover, it is not know whether such a model can go beyond predicting V1 responses to simplified visual stimuli such as bars and crosses. Can it predict responses to the more complex visual scenes that occur outside the laboratory? Earlier efforts to predict responses to complex stimuli have relied on minor variations of the receptive field model in spite of this models clear inadequacy. We propose a more promising line of attack. First, rely on the divisive model, which goes beyond the receptive field and promises to explain a large number of phenomena. Second, employ simple stimuli such as bars and crosses to constrain model parameters. Third, test the model on responses to complex stimuli such as artificial scenes from a cartoon and natural scenes filmed from the head of a cat roaming a forest. We would then like to investigate the effects of cognitive factors such as visual attention. Ultimately, our goal is to include these effects in our model, by expressing them in terms of their action on the model components. Our approach entails a combination of experiment and modeling, and requires multidisciplinary tools and skills. In addition to a neuroscientist (the PI), our team includes associates trained in Physics and Computer Science. In contrast to more traditional neurophysiology practice, we devote many hours of our experiments to the careful measurement of responses of individual neurons. The resulting large body of data requires months of analysis. To facilitate this analysis we have developed a number of tools. One of these tools allows us to simulate many hours of measurements obtained from single neurons. We can thus develop more and more refined models, and easily test those models on the very same sequence of visual stimuli that were presented during the experiment. Once we have achieved our goal of predicting V1 responses to a broad range of visual stimuli, we would refine and polish our software and database so that they can serve the community for scientific and educational purposes. Users would be able to upload still images or video sequences of their choice to our web site, which would then output the predicted response of any one of our V1 neurons. Visual scientists might find this service useful to predict or interpret the outcome of their experiments, and students and teachers could use it to gain a better understanding of the operation of the early visual system. In summary, our goal is an intuitive model of V1 responses that is constrained by a limited set of measurements, and predicts responses to complex video sequences. Such a succinct description of the computations performed in V1 could serve as a standard model, which is highly desirable to illuminate the relation between neural responses and perceptual effects. By bridging the gulf between simplified laboratory stimuli and arbitrary visual scenes, neurophysiology can illuminate the results of measurements of visual perception. The proposed research merits the support of the James S. McDonnell Foundation for three main reasons. First, it is important, with direct consequences for our interpretation of cognitive effects. Second, it is novel: although the individual components of the model we propose have been the object of decades of work, they have never before been put together in a single, cohesive model. Third, it is ambitious: our goal to predict responses of V1 neurons to complex, arbitrary stimuli has been pursued by few others, and has been achieved by none.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020044\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '310,716', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The synergistic potential of interdisciplinary research is a mainstay in the analysis of complex systems. Finding common threads and emergent patterns in seemingly disparate fields is an eective means to advance theory, increase applicability, and thus expand knowledge. Consider the following disciplines and associated issues: The dynamics of the scenarios described above for ecology, epidemiology, and genetics can be captured in a general sense with the same structured population model, which in ecology is referred to as a metapopulation model. Because of the structural parallels, these 3 systems have the same threshold condition. In ecology this is called the extinction threshold, and it maintains that the extinction of a species will occur if its habitat is reduced beyond a certain critical fraction determined by the species life history characteristics. In a similar fashion, it is not necessary to vaccinate all individuals or close all DNA to transposition in order to eradicate a disease or a transposable element. But there are several critical features of these systems that the simple metapopulation model fails to incorporate. All of these systems have an associated spatial landscape, whether it is comprised of habitat patches, a network of cities, or chromosomes. Yet, the structure of the landscape is not included in the simple metapopulation model. How can this model incorporate the intricacies of the landscape, and what predictive benefit is gained by adding such complexity to the model? Moreover, the simple model monitors the system at a metapopulation level operating at a slow time frame (colonization, extinction) but fails to incorporate the local patch dynamics occurring at a faster time scale (birth, death). What can be gained by adding this additional complexity, and does it help quantify these critical thresholds? Our research will focus primarily on ecological extensions of this structured population model. Our goal is to develop a theoretical framework for studying questions associated with landscape structure and change, in terms of their consequences for species persistence. This framework will be hierarchical in nature, with each new tier adding another level of complexity to model. Each model extension will be linked to a simulation study and then an empirical study. Simulation studies are helpful in evaluating analytic performance and the sensitivity of model parameters. Empirical studies will explore both experimental and natural landscapes. We believe this step is critical for validation of model performance. As we progress from simple to more complex models, we will ask: Does this added complexity capture an emerging property of the system? Is the added complexity justified in terms of gaining more predictive value? How does the model compare with simulation studies and empirical evidence? And ultimately, does this extension of the metapopulation model benefit our understanding of how species persist in complex landscapes? Once these questions are answered, we will transfer this knowledge to further our understanding of parallel problems in other fields, such as epidemiology and genetics.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Purdue University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020052\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '449,508', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Numerous studies have found precursors of these capacities in infants. For example, infants are able to discriminate sentences in different languages, distinguish sets of objects based on their numerosity or recognize known faces. These abilities are not very different from those of other animals. Monkeys are also able to discriminate two human languages, two quantities of items, or respond to particular faces. In a few years, however, children surpass these animals. To explain the development of the cognitive capacities of our species, two hypotheses are classically opposed: one postulates a particular brain organization that dedicates specific brain regions to these functions while the other postulates powerful general learning mechanisms, greater than those of other species thanks to a our larger brain and a rich cultural environment. To reconcile these opposing positions, a perhaps more plausible hypothesis considers that exposure to the human environment may take advantage of preexisting bias in human brain functional architecture. It is thus not necessary to postulate that the human genome codes directly for the human complex cognitive capacities but rather that it codes for initial biases in a cascade of biological events whose result is human cognition. Such an hypothesis is more compatible with recent descriptions of the massive overlap between the human genome and that of other mammals. The goal of this project is thus to explore the initial organization of the human brain with non invasive brain imaging techniques and to compare the responses of infants' and adults' brains to ecological stimuli that are significant for humans. Because of the recent application of brain imaging techniques in infants, this type of projects needs to pursue in parallel methodological and scientific questions. At a methodological level, the goal is to develop fMRI as a tool to explore infant's brain to complete high-density ERP. A first step will be to rely on demonstrated behavioral infants' capacities to refine fMRI experimental paradigms while investigating the cerebral bases of these capacities. A second step will be to study aspects of cognition that are not easily accessible to infants' behavioral paradigms, that are limited to novelty or familiarity overt responses. To study the functional organization of the brain, I propose to systematically exploit or phenomenon, that is the fact that neuronal response to a stimulus decreases with repetition. This phenomenon has been described at the single cell level but also at a macroscopic level in ERP recordings and fMRI. By manipulating what counts as a repetition, we can infer the code of the representation. For example in neonates, ERP amplitude decreases with syllable repetition but recovers after a change of phoneme. This is observed when the same physical syllable is repeated but also when different speakers produce the syllables. This demonstrates that a representation of syllables, speaker independent, is computed by infants as well as by adults. Two directions will be pursued in this project: 1)  To investigate the extent of functional specification for speech in infants and the similarities and differences with adults, two series of experiments are planned, one exploring the sentence level and the other the phoneme level. A) Although sentence comprehension is certainly very different in three-month-old infants and adults, the same left temporo-parietal network is involved in both populations. To clarify the different components of this network and their function, the same sentence (one every 14s) will be repeated several times, either identically or with the prosody flattened (intonation is removed) or hummed (phonology is removed). It is expected that fMRI activation will decrease in a network that is repeatedly involved in the same process. Identifying the exact condition under which a given brain area habituates will allow to specify what parameter each area is sensitive to. B) Based on the differences in topography of mismatch responses elicited by a change of stimuli in series of repeated auditory stimuli, I have suggested that the auditory system is organized very early on in several functional networks, coding the different properties of a sound. The exact topographical localization of these networks and their specificity to linguistic stimuli will be studied using the same A A A X paradigm with fast-event fMRI and high-density ERP. 2) In this second part of the project, I will use the habituation method to probe the anatomical bases and degree of abstraction of mental representations that are thought to be available in infants: faces, numbers, objects, etc.. For example, consider infants sensitivity to faces. Is it related to the particular visual characteristics of human faces, or to take an extreme opposite position, do faces already evoke an abstract representation of conspecifics whose specifications are not limited to face, but include a representation of the body, the voice, etc.? If it is the case, habituation to pictures of body parts should prime responses to faces and induce a decrease of activation in the networks computing conspecific recognition. By manipulating the distance between the context (pictures or sounds) and the target faces, it should be possible to characterize the degree of abstraction of infant's early knowledge of conspecifics. If this methodology proves productive, as suggested by our preliminary ERP results, the same experimental process would be applied to explore infants' knowledge in other domains, such as the relations between shapes, tools and actions, or number and space in ERP and fMRI. Through these experiments, I will ascertain whether several methodological paradigms in fMRI (blocks, slow and fast-event-related designs, priming method) successful in adults, are useful in infants while exploring how the early brain organization constrains infants' representations of the external world. Bridging brain, mind and behavior requires not only the study of the mature adult brain but also an understanding of the initial stages of brain organization. Progress in functional neuro-imaging provides tools to explore this question and to constrain models of cognitive development.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS)', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020043\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '423,100', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), brainstem stroke, brain or spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, multiple sclerosis, and numerous other degenerative diseases impair the neural pathways that control muscles or impair the muscles themselves. These disorders affect nearly two million people in the United States, and far more around the world. Those most affected may lose all voluntary muscle control, including eye movements and respiration, and may become completely \"locked-in\" to their bodies, unable to communicate in any way whatsoever. Conventional assistive communication devices require some voluntary muscle control, and thus they are often useless for people in this condition. At the same time, modern life-support technology, such as home ventilators, can allow most individuals, even those who are locked-in, to live long lives, so that the personal, social, and economic burdens of their disabilities are prolonged and severe. The capacity to communicate is critically important, and the absence of this capacity greatly reduces quality of life. Indeed, people with ALS often elect to die when they lose the power to communicate or to exert any control over their environment. Over the past 15 years, studies in many laboratories have shown that electroencephalographic activity (EEG, or brain waves) recorded from the scalp can provide new non-muscular communication and control channels. These brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) do not depend on voluntary muscle control, and thus they can be used by people who are severely paralyzed or even totally locked-in. Encouraged by new understanding of the brain, by the advent of powerful low-cost computers, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, BCI research focuses on developing new assistive communication and control technology that allows severely disabled people to express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. 299:496-499 (2003) provides an excellent short review of BCI research and development. Present-day BCIs use a variety of brain signals. These signals are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other devices. The user learns to encode commands in these signals and the BCI decodes the commands from the signals. BCIs can be non-invasive (i.e., they use scalp-recorded EEG signals) or invasive (i.e., they use neuronal activity or field potentials recorded in or on the cortex). Non-invasive BCIs are commonly perceived to be suited only for simple communication, while invasive BCIs are thought to be applicable to more demanding applications such as real-time control of neuroprostheses or robotic devices. (A neuroprosthesis is a device that can stimulate the muscles of a paralyzed limb so that the person can use the limb again.) On the other hand, invasive BCIs face greater technical difficulties and entail substantial clinical risks. The motivation for this project is a strong conviction that non-invasive BCIs can in fact provide real-time control of complex movements. This conviction has two sources. First, recent studies in our laboratory have improved non-invasive BCI methods to a point suggesting that, with continued improvement, non-invasive BCIs should be able to provide multidimensional real-time control of a robotic arm or other prosthetic device. Second, while prosthesis operation has been conceived of as a problem of process control (i.e., controlling the details of movement), it is more realistically conceived of as a problem of recognizing intent. This is certainly true on a conscious level: we think \"I want to pick up that book\" rather than \"I want to activate these muscles at these strengths in this sequence so that my hand reaches out and picks up that book.\" Furthermore, due to the wellestablished distributed organization of brain function, the real-time details of movement control are handled largely at subcortical, brainstem, and spinal cord levels, rather than exclusively by the cortical neurons that are the focus of invasive BCIs. Thus, the development of invasive BCIs that vest detailed movement control in cortical neurons is not only technically difficult and clinically risky, but also artificial and simply unnecessary. It is more realistic and practical to focus BCI research on recognizing intent, and having downstream software manage the process that achieves that intent. Once intent is known, process control is a relatively straightforward engineering problem, whether it is control of a robotic arm or a neuroprosthesis. Recent studies show that non-invasive BCI methods can indeed convey intent rapidly and consistently. This proposal's central hypothesis is that non-invasive BCIs can enable users to control threedimensional movements of a robotic arm (i.e., a prototype prosthesis) at speeds nearly comparable to normal movements. The goal is to show that normal volunteers and people with disabilities can master such control. The specific aims are: (1) to improve current scalp-recorded EEG-based BCI control to move a robotic arm rapidly and accurately in two dimensions; (2) to extend that control to rapid and accurate movement in three dimensions; (3) to further extend that control to functions such as moving an object from one place to another or pouring water into a cup; (4) to show that people with severe disabilities (e.g., locked in by late-stage ALS or brainstem stroke) can use this technology and that it improves their quality of life. In accord with the Foundation's 21st Century Initiative, this project spans neural, cognitive, and behavioral levels of analysis and fits into the \"Applied Research\" category. It is interdisciplinary, involving neurophysiology, neuropsychology, signal analysis, engineering, and clinical rehabilitation. Our laboratory has expertise in all these areas, extensive experience in BCI research, and encouraging preliminary data. We are confident that, with the Foundation's support, we can achieve the specific aims and thereby greatly extend the capacities of non-invasive BCI technology to provide important new control capacities and improved quality of life to people with severe disabilities. This work should also yield new understanding of the interactions between conscious intent, as formatted in cortex and associated areas, and its execution by lower-level natural or artificial structures.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'New York State Department of Health', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

All this must happen on-line while we continue to listen, speak, read, or write. It thus seems very logical to assume that language function is implemented in the form of networks, with continuous rapid exchange of information between several brain areas. Interacting neural networks during visual perception and motor performance have been demonstrated in animal studies where neural activity can be recorded directly from the cortex. However, at present it is not possible to investigate real-time information transfer within large-scale neural networks in the human brain during natural language performance. Why is that? We would need to identify groups of brain areas with similar time courses of activation. Such correlation would indicate that these areas talk to each other, and systematic time lags between the time courses would suggest a specific sequence of activation within the network. Modern functional imaging tools have made it possible to identify active brain areas safely from signals recorded outside of the head. When a brain area is active, communication between neurons becomes more intense and the electrical current in this area is increased. The neurons now need more oxygen and that is brought to the hungry cells by increasing blood flow to this brain area. Imaging methods which detect changes in blood flow or oxygenation (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI, positron emission tomography, PET) provide accurate localization of the active areas (1 mm). Unfortunately, these measures vary slowly, over periods of seconds, when the actual neural changes take place in milliseconds (0.001 sec). These techniques are thus not appropriate for analysis of real-time connectivity. For accurate timing, one needs to turn to neurophysiological methods (magnetoencephalography, MEG, electroencephalography, EEG). They detect the electric (EEG) and magnetic fields (MEG) directly associated with neuronal currents. With these methods, however, localization of the active areas is quite difficult due to the complex mathematical relationship between electric current and electromagnetic field patterns, and to the large changes of electric conductivity at the borders between brain, skull, and scalp. Fortunately, magnetic field passes the skull and the scalp essentially unaffected. With MEG, one can readily determine both the locations of active brain areas with reasonable accuracy (1 cm) and the relative timing of activation in these areas. MEG thus seems like an obvious choice for network analysis. However, the additional demand of finding not only active areas but groups of areas with correlated time courses of activation makes the problem enormously demanding conceptually, mathematically, and computationally. We have now succeeded in developing a technique where we first compute correlation measures between the MEG sensors, and from these signals identify pairs of brain areas with correlated time courses of activation. When brought together, these multiple pairs of brain areas form large-scale neural networks. The method has been successfully tested on a finger movement task. Here, muscle activity recorded from the finger served as an external, non-brain, reference signal which simplified the analysis considerably. We are now ready to face the challenge of searching for neural networks during natural internally-driven language performance, where no external timing signals nor prior assumptions about connected areas are available. The first tests on real-time functional connectivity during reading are promising. Our aim in this project is to extract, visualize, and quantify large-scale neural networks and the relative timing within these networks during real-life language tasks. These results will be compared with earlier research on language function obtained with the currently available experimental designs and analysis techniques. We hope to track neural networks supporting natural speech perception, speech production, free discussion, reading, and writing, and the possible interaction between perception and production. Linguistic communication is an integral part of human cognition, and of humanity itself. Impairments in language perception or production are experienced as exceptionally limiting and even unbearable. Our method holds great promise for elucidating the neural basis of language disorders. For example, stuttering is a developmental language disorder in which timing within the neural network is likely to be the main issue and which emerges fully, and can thus be best investigated, during natural speech production. In aphasia, where local brain damage results in deterioration of language function, it would be very informative to evaluate entire brain systems involved in the patients's natural language performance and the possible changes with rehabilitation. Finally, one may ask whether language affects the overall patterns of connectivity in our brains. If it does, an obvious question is how much such language-driven connectivity might influence any other tasks we perform. The possible effect of different languages on the organization of functional networks in the human brain may turn out to be an exciting future line of research.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Helsinki University of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020048\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The personal and societal burden from cancer cannot be overstated. The World Health Organization estimates that in the next 10 years, 84 million people will die of the disease. Eradicating the large, diverse and adaptive populations found in most cancers presents a formidable challenge. One cc of cancer contains about 109 transformed cells, so that there are more cancer cells in 10 grams of tumor (a modest size by oncology standards) than there are people on Earth. Unequal cell division and differences in genetic lineages and micro-environmental selection pressures produce complex evolutionary dynamics that result in genetically and phenotypically diverse tumor cell populations. Additionally, tumors are complex ecosystems that include normal cells and blood vessels. That latter are typically dysfunctional resulting in regions of diminished blood flow and oxygen and increased acid concentrations. Cancer, in other words, is a complex, evolutionary system. While the biomedical research community’s “war on cancer” has, in many ways, been remarkably successful, these advances have had only slight impact on the mortality rates from most common disseminated cancers. This apparent disconnect is both an illustration and result of the complexity and diversity of cancers. Each individual tumor represents a new and novel disease generated by an idiosyncratic pathway of in-vivo selection and cellular adaptation. As a result, genetic lineages differ between cancers and even within populations of the same tumor. It is, thus, not surprising that the corresponding experimental data is both vast and difficult to synthesize. This situation is not unprecedented and is, in fact, typical of experimental observations in complex systems. In the 16th century Tycho Brahe amassed huge data sets on planetary motions but their orbits seemed to follow no apparent rules within the prevailing paradigm that the earth was the center of the universe. In the early 20th century, the Balmer lines were observed. These were inexplicable within the conventional model of the atom. In the 1950’s, experimental physicists uncovered a bewildering and unruly “zoo” of subatomic particles. Understanding, in each case, required development of comprehensive theoretical models that encompassed the experimental observations but were framed mathematically from first principles (heliocentricity and gravity, quantum mechanics, and the “standard model” respectively). This lockstep of first principles and empiricism (observations and experiments) leads to paradigm shifts, and the understanding of complex system dynamics as the manifestation of generally simple rules operating in real systems with many interacting parts (the kaleidoscope phenomenon). These experiences in reconciling seemingly impossible masses of data lead with first principles leads to our fundamental hypothesis: Cancer is clearly very complex, but it is not incomprehensibly so. Our proposal is that substantive advances in cancer therapy will require a similar comprehensive, quantitative theoretical model (4,5). Theodosius Dobzhansky famously stated \"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\". Similarly, we propose that cancer, perhaps uniquely among human illnesses, is a disease that arises through Darwinian interactions of microenvironmental selection and phenotypic adaptation, which are both causes and consequences of its complexity and heterogeneity. Interestingly, Dobzhansky also (and less famously) stated “Scientists often have a naive faith that if only they could discover enough facts about a problem, these facts would somehow arrange themselves in a compelling and true solution.” A key lesson from previous scientific investigation of complex systems is that data alone are not sufficient for understand the underlying dynamics. Complex, evolutionary dynamics can only be understood through application of suitable non-linear mathematical models. The specific goal of this proposal is to integrate the first principles of evolution by natural selection (heritable variation in tumor cell lines, a struggle for existence within and among tumor cell populations, and this variation influences how cell lines fair in the struggle) into quantitative and experimental methods, and into new strategies for cancer therapy. We propose that cancers are subject to the same governing principles found in the evolution of populations of plants and animals in the natural world. These rules must, of course, be adapted to cancer’s unique in-vivo adaptive landscapes, but nevertheless can provide the necessary framework to guide therapeutic strategies.

Even scientists increasingly use social media to share discoveries within the scientiﬁc community. Social media may have a profound impact on the acceleration of innovation and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries, but like any technology it is fraught with inherent dangers as well. Used to spread false information, spam, and malware, social media affect our political discourse, making it easier to talk to echo chambers of people who think like us, thus facilitating the polarization of public opinion. It has been argued that information ﬂows are key determinants of the functioning and the structure of society. From this thesis it follows that the study of information ﬂows may elucidate the complex working mechanisms behind human organizations. With this motivation, our project explores one key question: As an increasing portion of human activities shift to the online world, social media have become a powerful lens for observing broad swaths of human behavior: whom we befriend, how we communicate, what information we consume, produce, and propagate. The dynamics of this vast, networked, complex system emerge from the interactions of countless individuals. Despite the importance of online social networks in our society, our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the collective dynamics of online information diffusion is still in its infancy. The good news is that the study of the mathematical regularities behind complex patterns of human dynamics is for the ﬁrst time , thanks to the availability of social media data. In particular, our access to massive data streams from microblogging networks such as , , and allows us to revisit the assumptions made in classical models of information diffusion. The proposed project directly answers a call for a social science, a radically new way to study social phenomena via a complex systems approach. Our coupled data analysis and modeling efforts seek to understand the complex emergent patterns generated by online human interaction through the simulation of stylized agent behaviors. There is a long tradition of modeling the spread of information as an epidemic diffusion process. A piece of information can pass from one individual to another through social contact and ‘infected’ individuals can, in turn, propagate this information to others, possibly generating a full-scale contagion. Although noticeable progress has been made in the last decade in the study of idea contagion, most of the approaches are rather speculative and borrow heavily from the vast literature on the spread of infectious disease. The ﬁeld has struggled with the lack of large-scale data and the intrinsic difﬁculties in quantitatively modeling any process of social contagion. For, while the analogy with biological epidemics is conceptually appealing, the information contagion process encompasses many more facets than the biological one. For instance, almost no social network can be considered to be a closed system, therefore a mixture of endogenous and exogenous factors shape the behavior of information spread. Broadcasts by traditional media may have enormous inﬂuence on the speed and duration of diffusion processes as well, with the mutual interaction and feedback loops between traditional and online media further complicating the modeling of exogenous factors. A more practical obstacle is that the structure of the underlying social network is often unknown. Because of these difﬁculties we lack the commonly-accepted, empirically-validated, and increasingly-detailed models that are amenable to producing testable hypotheses. So far, discriminating between competing models of the microscopic processes that drive the diffusion of information has been problematic. The advent of the Web and social media have given us an opportunity to study social phenomena in more quantitative ways. For example, in our group we have analyzed Web trafﬁc to understand how we satisfy our information needs. We have examined how our attention is indirectly driven by Web authors, as their links are aggregated by the ranking algorithms employed by search engines. Finally, we have explored sudden bursts of global attention as revealed by the temporal shifts in the trends of Wikipedia topics. Data from microblogging networks are now providing researchers with a much more direct probe into the dynamics of social communication. Twitter in particular has generated much attention due to its peculiar features, enormous popularity, and data sharing policy. To carry out the proposed research, we will develop a computational infrastructure that will enable the study of meme diffusion in large-scale social media by collecting, analyzing, classifying, visualizing, and modeling massive streams of public microblogging data. The results of this effort will then drive the development of general models for the behavior of users and the spread of ideas in social networks. We will start by analyzing diffusion patterns for ideas, focusing on cascade size distributions and popularity time series. The driving questions of our analysis will be: Why do some ideas cause viral explosions while others do not receive any attention? Why do some topics remain popular for months while others are forgotten in a matter of minutes? Is it possible to identify a set of representative behaviors that can help us design quantitative, predictive models of idea contagion? To what extent do online information diffusion processes lend themselves to being modeled like epidemics? Social media are blurring the boundaries between information production and consumption. Traditionally these roles were clearly distinct, while today anyone can create and share content with anyone who cares to read it with a simple click. Can we identify different roles in this new landscape? Do we observe patterns similar to traditional mass-media, where there are only a few broadcasters and masses of passive consumers of information? Does everyone play both roles? In our modeling effort we will explore several key ingredients that might explain the observed information contagion patterns: the social network on which ideas travel; the role and inﬂuence of users; the topical interests of users as reﬂected in the content of their information exchanges; competition for limited attention; and the aging of information. All of these elements interact with each other. For instance, our social links change with our interests; the inﬂuence of users depends on their social status and topical expertise; and our friends and the information to which we are exposed affect our interests. While all of these mechanisms can be explored through agent-based models, it is clear that such processes are much more complex than, for example, the spread of a virus like H1N1. Quantitatively modeling the basic ingredients of such a process along with their interplay is the crucial challenge that the present proposal aims to meet.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Indiana University - Bloomington', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020274\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The obvious strategy is just to search in the most likely places. But if it is pitch dark, tactile search may be difficult and time consuming. You might try to spend more time recalling your moves in an effort to allocate your keys then simply search for them. Such situations are the everyday experience of a blind person. As another example, have you ever tried following the developments of a basketball game on the radio rather then watching it on TV. In such a case, you must rely on verbal rather than visual information. Blind people are therefore likely to depend more on memory in general, and on verbal memory in specific, to interact with the world. Indeed, some studies indicate that the congenitally blind have superior verbal memory abilities. Anecdotally, our ancestors must have been aware of this. In ancient times the blind often served as a 'living database' of the interpretations of the bible (which were passed from generation to generation by word of mouth), and a quotation of a biblical source by a blind person was considered the most reliable. As the Talmud says . How does this come about? Humans, like other primates, rely primarily on vision to direct their behavior. The areas devoted to vision constitute a substantial part of our brain (~25% of the primate brain). In the past, the prevailing thought was that loss of vision due to blindness renders these regions useless. Recently, though, evidence has been accumulating that the 'unemployed' occipital cortex, which usually subserves vision, may be utilized in the blind for other purposes. Neuroimaging techniques have indicated that the occipital cortex of congenitally blind people is active during Braille reading. Furthermore, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex disrupts the blind participants' ability to identify correctly Braille letters. These findings and others that followed led to the hypothesis that the occipital cortex of the blind is recruited for tactile information processing.  Yet Braille reading involves more than just fine tactile judgments, since any reading obviously engages cognitive (language related) facilities as well. We recently found using functional imaging (fMRI) in the congenitally blind, that extensive regions within the occipital cortex are activated not only during Braille reading, but also during performance of verbal memory tasks, such as recalling a list of abstract words. One of these activated regions was the primary visual cortex or V1, which is the central gateway for visual information processing in the normal human brain. In contrast, no such verbal memory related activation was found in V1 of the sighted control group. This V1 activation, unique to the blind, was mirrored by superior verbal memory skills of the blind as a group, compared to their sighted peers. As usual, significant variation exists among the blind in their verbal memory performance. But most important, the magnitude of V1 activation during the verbalmemory condition was highly correlated with the blind individual's abilities in a variety of verbalmemory tests, suggesting that the additional occipital activation may have a functional role. Thus, subjects that showed greater occipital activation (in its extent and magnitude), were usually the ones to score best in the verbal memory tests used. These correlations were most dramatic in V1, were specific to tasks involving verbal memory, and were not explained by variation in the subjects' intelligence quotient (IQ), or education. We also found evidence for topographical specialization in the reorganized occipital cortex of the blind. While the more anterior regions of the occipital cortex show preference for the tactile Braille condition, V1 showed for conditions involving verbal memory. This gradient may reflect 'reverse hierarchical' organization. Visual processing in the sighted brain is typically described in hierarchical terms. Cortical responses in V1 are generally governed by the basic physical aspects of the stimulus (such as bar size, orientation or direction of motion). As one moves to higher visual processing regions, the stimulus eliciting the greatest response becomes more complex. The neurons in those areas show relative invariance to the object defining cue, size, position, viewpoint or even modality. This probably reflects a more abstract representation in these putative object related regions. Interestingly, in total absence of visual input this hierarchy seems to be reversed. Thus, early visual regions are active during more 'cognitive' functions (such as verbal memory) while the more anterior regions are more 'sensory' (showing robust tactile activation). It is currently unclear how this reorganization comes about. One possibility is that it might be based on existing anatomical connections between visual cortex and classical memory areas in the frontal cortex and temporal lobes. Some of these projections to the visual cortex are much more extensive in the newborn, but attenuate gradually. In congenital blindness, these feedback pathways might be enhanced due to the lack of competition from visual input, giving rise to the functional plasticity reported here. To summarize, we have reasons to believe that the visual cortex may undergo a dramatic reorganization during the first years of life, to be recruited for high-level cognitive functions. There is some evidence that this plasticity is much more limited in people blinded at later stages. The exact cognitive components that are responsible for the occipital activation (memory?, language?) as well as the functional significance of this cortical reorganization, are still unknown. This study will potentially open a window for understanding cortical plasticity in brain systems, which is crucial for future treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, if we know more about how this cortical reorganization can take place, and stimulate it by proper training, we can possibly give blind people an advantage that will serve them throughout life.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Hebrew University of Jerusalem', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020046\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

My lab studies these impairments as a model for answering fundamental questions in cognitive neuroscience. Our work spans the gamut from basic science, querying brain plasticity and sensory integration, to cutting-edge technological developments, allowing blind persons to “see” with sensory substitution devices (SSDs). These devices code visual information and represent it using sound or touch. We aim to augment impaired vision, and even help restore vision using SSDs. We have recently shown, using SSDs, that at least two key visual brain areas are in fact highly flexible, modality-independent (and even visual-experience independent) task machines. Here we further hypothesize that all visual areas can process sound and touch to the same extent as they process vision, but only when subjects learn to extract all the relevant information (depth, facial features, etc.) encoded by these alternative senses. We propose that, with proper training, any brain area can change the type of sensory input it uses to retrieve task-relevant information within a matter of days. Based on the insights gained so far using veteran SSDs, we propose to develop several innovative SSDs which will encode the most crucial aspects of vision and make them accessible to the blind, along with targeted, simple training paradigms. For instance, the “EyeCane”, a palm-size cane, which encodes distance and depth accurately and efficiently. We provide preliminary evidence that, following rehabilitation-oriented training, these SSDs can be used as stand-alone devices. This wide range of SSD applications will enable us to probe the task-specificity of the involved brain structures. To achieve this, our SSDs will be used in conjunction with cutting-edge neuroimaging and neurodisruptive techniques. We will chart the dynamics of the plastic changes in the brain by performing unprecedented longitudinal studies while individuals learn to use SSDs. This will allow us to probe the theory of brain areas as flexible sensory-modality-independent task-specific entities and promote our understanding of sensory integration and large scale brain plasticity. Finally, these devices may be used together with the most advanced visual prostheses (“bionic eyes”) currently in the market, which at present lack in terms of resolution and in rehabilitative power. The SSDs may be used in training the brain to “see” prior to surgery, and in augmenting the capabilities of the “bionic-eyes” using information arriving from the same image (e.g. adding color, depth and, most critically, increased resolution) to create a unique and novel entity: an SSD-bionic eye hybrid. Our proposed research will lead to major advances in the understanding of brain functionality, adaptation following neural injury and changes taking place in the process of rehabilitation.

In the past, diagnosis was solely derived from histopathological assessment of the tumor tissue. Recent evidence from genome‐wide screening projects (including DNA copy‐number analysis, gene expression profiling, and DNA¬methylation analyses) clearly suggests that medulloblastoma in fact is a group of molecularly, epidemiologically, and prognostically distinct diseases comprising at least four major variants. Across all of these molecular variants, patients with microscopic or macroscopic dissemination of their tumor (throughout the CNS, occasionally even throughout the body) have a much worse probability of being cured. One major reason, why brain tumors as a group have replaced leukemias (although the latter being much more common) as the leading cause of cancer death in children, is that our knowledge of the genetic repertoire of leukemias is much more comprehensive. These scientific insights have been successfully exploited for molecular diagnostics, treatment monitoring, tailoring treatment intensity to disease risk, and molecular targeted therapies in selected cases for more than a decade. This body of knowledge is only starting to grow for medulloblastoma, the deadliest brain tumor in children. A clinically challenging decision on whether to regard patients as clinical high risk is the definition of “microscopic metastases”. To justify this diagnosis, “united cell structures” of malignant cells have to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients at the time of primary diagnosis according to a widely used classification system proposed by Chang and colleagues in the late 1960s. It is anticipated, however, that almost all patients have some kind of CSF dissemination and that medulloblastoma is in fact a disease that involves the entire CNS rather than only the cerebellum, where the primary tumor occurs. This might be illustrated by the fact, that many patients who are considered non‐metastatic at the time of diagnosis, will develop a relapse at a distant site, e.g., the spine. Patients with recurrent disease have a fatal prognosis. Most of them die within one year after tumor recurrence was diagnosed. As a result of this, a refined detection of CSF dissemination is urgently warranted and a very promising avenue to achieve this is by tracking and quantifying tumor‐specific genetic aberrations in this bodily liquid. Identifying tumor‐specific mutations in cellular and non‐cellular DNA floating in the CSF could not only be used for the diagnosis of CSF dissemination, but also for molecular subgrouping, treatment monitoring (i.e., clearance of the CSF in the course of treatment), and surveillance of patients after completing treatment (i.e., detection of early microscopic relapse). The latter two aspects are again in analogy to a very successful concept that has been applied in leukemia patients for many years, namely “minimal residual disease monitoring”. In leukemia patients, this is achieved by detecting characteristic genetic aberrations in the leukemia cell clone in the bone marrow down to a level of 1 tumor cell in 100.000 normal cells. This information is used all over the world to stratify patients into therapy groups with different treatment intensity, to monitor treatment response, and for early detection of leukemia recurrence. If it was possible to use CSF genetics for the same purpose in brain tumor patients, this would revolutionize current clinical practice. Our approach to test the feasibility of using CSF genetics in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of medulloblastoma patients involves three important steps. In a first phase, we will investigate 30 medulloblastoma patients, from whom we have collected frozen tumor samples, CSF at primary diagnosis, and blood (germline control). By sequencing all coding exons in the tumor DNA using next‐generation sequencing techniques and compare these with the germline of the same patient, we will determine the repertoire of somatic (i.e., tumor specific) mutations in these 30 tumor samples. In a second step, we will quantify the abundance of 5‐10 tumor‐specific mutations in the CSF of the respective patient down to a resolution of 1 copy of the mutant allele in 100 copies of the wildtype (germline) allele. Finally, in the third phase of the project we will be able to compare serial CSF samples from ten patients over the course of their disease to assess, whether it was possible to quantify molecular CSF clearance after chemotherapy. Preliminary data obtained from a pilot patient who´s tumor harbored somatic mutations in the two cancer genes and , demonstrates that it is feasible to extract sufficient amounts of high quality DNA from 1 ml of CSF for at least 30‐50 PCR reactions and to detect tumor‐specific mutations in a semi‐quantitative fashion. This pilot project intriguingly demonstrates the principal feasibility of our approach, which now has to be proven on a larger basis in a reasonably large cohort of patients (independent of the presence of microscopic dissemination by cytological definition). In summary, we strongly believe that genetic tests in the CSF of medulloblastoma patients has the potential to significantly influence clinical decision making in terms of diagnosis, assessment of therapy response, selection of therapeutic agents, and patient surveillance. Therefore, we think our proposal exactly serves the major goals of the JSM foundation call on brain cancer research, namely the generation of novel insights leading to increased cure rates and improve functional outcome for brain tumor patients in a truly translational sense.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'German Cancer Research Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2011', 'amount': '159,390', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These genetic circuits can control nonlinear dynamic behaviors such as cellular decision-making and differentiation, by integrating extracellular signals and computing appropriate responses. Comprehensive understanding of these biological processes cannot be achieved by investigating single proteins or genes one at a time, but rather require a systems-level analysis of the underlying genetic circuit dynamics. It is therefore essential to uncover the design principles of these gene regulatory circuits and develop a theory that explains the interactions within them and how they function at the systems-level. This information will help us better comprehend and predict circumstances in which gene circuit operation may fail and lead to complex diseases. Such knowledge will be particularly valuable in developing systems-level based treatment of diseases by identifying optimal targets for regulating gene circuit operations. This type of directed therapy could have the added benefit of reducing side effects commonly associated with treatment. In cells, genetic circuits commonly regulate each other, constituting an additional level of complexity. For simplicity, systems-level studies to date have investigated genetic circuits that control distinct biological processes in conceptual isolation. This approach has been fruitful, and in recent years several groups including us, have been able to develop mathematical theories on how small genetic circuits generate specific cellular behaviors. However, genetic circuits we consider in conceptual isolation interact with each other in the cell, establishing uncharted higher levels of complexity and behavior. Here we aim to develop a mathematical theory describing how two complex gene regulatory circuits that each control mutually exclusive cellular processes, interact with each other. Specifically, this work will establish a mathematical understanding of how cross-regulation between genetic circuits ultimately determines cellular behavior. Multipotent cellular differentiation is a particularly striking example where interactions between genetic circuits determine cell fate. During this developmental process, individual cells can differentiate into one of several possible states. For example, a hematopoietic stem cell can differentiate among others, into a B-cell, lymphocyte or red blood cell. The choice and progression towards a specific cell fate is typically regulated by complex interactions between distinct differentiation circuits. An ideal simple model system to study how complex cross-regulation between gene regulatory circuits controls multipotent differentiation, is the stress response of the soil bacteria . Under nutrient limiting conditions, individual cells can differentiate into a spore or become competent and take up extracellular DNA. The distinct genetic circuits that control sporulation and competence have been well characterized. However, we currently lack critical understanding as to how these circuits interact with each other and determine the outcome of differentiation. Previously we utilized a combination of mathematical modeling and single cell quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, to develop a systems-level theory describing how the competence circuit controls differentiation into competence (Süel , Nature, 2006). Through this approach, we demonstrated that the competence circuit constitutes, what is known in the field of nonlinear dynamics as an excitable system. We have shown that, consistent with excitable dynamics, competence is a transiently differentiated state that is initiated in a probabilistic manner. Interestingly, action potentials in neurons are also triggered by an excitable system, emphasizing the generality of nonlinear dynamics concepts in elucidating the behavior of complex biological processes. Most recently, we performed a comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis of competence circuit function across parameter values, noise levels, and circuit architectures (Süel , Science, 2007). The results of this study provided an understanding of the dynamic competence system well beyond its normal operating regime. We showed that the competence circuit possesses remarkable, and inter-related, properties of tunability, robustness, and noise-dependence. This work also provided direct experimental evidence that a differentiation circuit is triggered by noise. Such a probabilistic view of biological processes is a new concept in biology, and bares resemblance to the quantum mechanical revolution in physics that occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. The systems-level understanding of the competence circuit we have obtained provides a unique starting point to investigate how interactions between the competence and sporulation circuits regulate multipotent cellular differentiation in . We will use continuous and discrete simulations to develop a theoretical systems-level framework describing the interactions between the competence and sporulation circuits. The mathematical modeling will be utilized to generate specific hypothesis regarding the cross-regulation between the two circuits that can be tested experimentally. On the experimental side, we will measure the dynamics of multiple competence and sporulation circuit components simultaneously in single cells. This will be accomplished by generating strains that contain multiple fluorescent reporter proteins with distinguishable colors to follow the activities of various circuit components. Using our expertise in quantitative multi-color fluorescence time-lapse microscopy we will then record movies of these strains as cells choose and execute distinct differentiation programs. Through image analysis of these movies, we will measure the interaction dynamics of the underlying genetic circuits during differentiation. Additionally, we will perform specific genetic perturbations to “re-wire” the competence and sporulation circuits to experimentally test high-level properties such as circuit memory and cell fate outcome. We are particularly interested in identifying whether genetic circuits that interact with each other, retain memory of their circuit state prior to their interaction. Perhaps, circuits can also retain a memory of the cross interaction itself, that could affect future interactions between circuits. Answers to such high-level questions regarding circuit cross-regulation and dynamics will be extremely valuable in developing a theoretical foundation that describes genetic circuit interactions at the systems-level. Developing a “theory of genetic circuits” will have the additional benefit of bringing together researchers from many diverse fields. The broad appeal of such a theory is partially based on the fact that this proposed project combines elements from many diverse scientific fields. Aside from biologists, a genetic circuit theory would also be of interest to scientists from the fields of Mathematics, Physics, Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering. Finally, one of the most important long term benefits to come from this work would be in the development of novel strategies for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Among the current problems of drug therapy are the severe side effects associated with treatment. Side effects commonly arise when we target a process in the cell such as cell death, by designing a drug to a key protein that often has numerous interactions with many different proteins and genes in the cell. Due to the many interactions the drug target has with different proteins, however, other unintended critical processes in cells can also be affected. A systems-level understating of genetic circuits could not only improve our understanding and prediction of side effects, but more importantly could also identify new targets with fewer side effects. For example, instead of trying to alter a cellular process by designing a drug to a protein with several critical interactions, we could perturb the same cellular process by identifying and targeting another component of the circuit with far fewer vital interactions. Medical treatment of complex diseases such as cancer would especially benefit from such a novel approach to identifying drug targets for therapy. This work is designed to make complex biological processes such as development, conceptually accessible by building a theoretical systems-level framework to describe the underlying genetic circuit interactions. Ultimately, such high-level insight into fundamental biological processes may lead to new and improved methods of treatment for diseases.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020141\\n', 'year': '2007', 'amount': '433,476', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Although you would probably perceive the light most of the time, you may occasionally make mistakes. We will, of course, blame our brains for our imperfect performance. However, the reason why we sometimes make errors, even in the simplest tasks, could stand behind a fundamental principle of neuronal information processing. Thus, the brain is not a passive camera-like device that records every event in the environment, but is an active device interpreting rather than simply reporting external events. Understanding this interpretative act requires knowledge about what happens in the brain in the absence of stimulation. Indeed, the brain is never at rest. Even in the absence of sensory inputs, brain cells spontaneously fire electrical impulses to make neuronal networks wander through different states. It is these intrinsic fluctuations that filter our perception of the world to make us see things differently depending on the brain's internal context. For instance, if a stimulus is presented at the 'wrong' time, when neuronal fluctuations are very large, the stimulus may not be distinguished from internal noise, hence it will most likely go unnoticed.  The idea that the brain has an internal state, or context, is not new. About 60 years ago, when digital computers were not available, psychologists and physiologists were striving to measure variations in brain rhythms while humans were performing specific behavioral tasks. The motivating question was whether the brain's internal state is able to shape sensory processing. One example is the alpha rhythm, which is measured over the occipital region. This rhythm is fairly regular, but waxing and waning, and has a dominant frequency around 10 Hz when the person is awake and relaxed. Although attempts to view the alpha rhythm as a cycle of neuronal excitability that allows us to see better in the 'high' state and to see worse in the 'low' state led to inconsistent results, they opened up the intriguing possibility that the brain's internal state could in fact influence perception. However, the technique available at the time, i.e., electroencephalography (EEG), although allowed to record voltage signals from the scalp, was unable to explain the origin of the recorded signals. Furthermore, EEG signals represent average changes in electrical field over large brain regions, hence they lack the degree of spatial resolution required to truly understand the relationship between neuronal internal states and behavior. The recent development of the technique of multiple electrode electrophysiological recording in behaving animals has made possible experiments addressing the relationship between neuronal internal states and behavioral performance. Using this technique we plan to study how the internal state of neuronal networks in the monkey brain influences how individual cells encode information to control behavior.  The focus of our studies is the visual cortex, which is the brain region that allows us to perceive the world. When we look at a visual scene, cells in the visual cortex respond to information streaming in from millions of \"wires\" that carry a pixilated image of the world to construct an internal representation. At the first stages of cortical processing, primary visual areas create a fragmented picture of the world, dominated, for instance, by small oriented lines highlighting edges. This representation is subsequently passed on to a higher functioning level of the visual cortex, where neurons typically respond to more complex image features, such as shapes and objects. One of the strengths of this hierarchical model of visual processing is the focus on the representation of images. Clearly, it is the hierarchical model that helped realize that images have a distributed representation across many cortical areas, and that these representations need to interact among each other in order to create a crystal-clear percept of the world. However, one problem with the hierarchical model is the fact that it ignores the temporal aspects of visual processing, despite overwhelming evidence that visual perception is , not static. Hence, constructing a cortical representation of the world requires not only knowledge about the physical aspect of incoming stimuli, but also information about the state of neuronal networks involved in stimulus processing. It is the interaction between the neuronal response to a stimulus and the neuronal state or context what defines a real-time cortical representation. Understanding how neuronal context interacts with incoming stimuli to produce behavioral responses is essential to uncovering the basic principles of cortical function.  There are at least two ways in which the state of the cortex can change: (1) by intrinsic fluctuations in spontaneous, or ongoing, activity, and (2) by fluctuations in the behavioral state of the organism, possibly due to changes in the level of alertness, arousal, or attention. Whether and how these types of statedependent changes in neuronal activity have any functional significance is unknown. We plan to address these issues by combining visual behavior and physiology. That is, we will directly measure neuronal activity in visual cortex when monkeys perform specific visual tasks that allow to control both the visual stimuli and the behavioral state of the animal. The choice of rhesus monkeys for the proposed research is based on several important advantages offered by this species, such as visual performance that rivals that of humans in many respects. There is a growing body of evidence that the visual cortical machinery of rhesus monkey closely parallels that of humans, hence the results of our research will be directly relevant to humans.  We will pursue two lines of experiments that may bring us closer to understanding what happens to our brain as we experience the world. First, do individual neurons in the visual cortex encode similar stimuli differently depending on the level of spontaneous, or ongoing, activity? If they do, how does statedependent coding of visual information affect perceptual discriminations? Second, how does neuronal context change when the behavioral state of the animal is altered? Behavioral state can possibly change ongoing activity in visual cortex through feedback connections. These connections are believed to convey global information about behavioral context and state from cognitive areas down to the visual cortex. At the beginning, we will study changes in internal state induced by attention and task demands. Subsequently, we will explore a completely new phenomenon: How does the expectation of reward induce state-dependent changes in neuronal activity, and how do the changes influence neuronal and behavioral performance? In the cerebral cortex, reward effects have been exclusively examined in the higher areas. Therefore, understanding whether and how the expectation of reward affects visual processing would be a groundbreaking example of how even basic cortical processes underlying low to mid-level vision could be modulated by the internal state of the animal. The results will contribute to a revision in our understanding of how visual inputs are combined with non-visual (reward) signals to encode behaviorally-relevant visual features, and are likely to have an impact on central coding in other sensory systems.  Understanding what happens in the brain in the absence of sensory inputs constitutes a new direction of my lab's research. Whys is this direction important is pursue? One key function of the brain is to construct and dynamically modify representations of the environment, and then use these representations to control behavior. By taking advantage of neuronal context and state, individual neurons can adapt rapidly to changes in the environment to efficiently encode relevant information. We believe that this information processing principle is by no means restricted to the visual cortex. Its simplicity makes it a strong candidate for a general principle that may be implemented throughout the brain. We suggest the possibility that neurons in higher-level cortical areas could exhibit emotional and cognitive state dependency. For instance, listening to the same song every day could elicit different emotional reactions depending on the state of neuronal networks involved in song processing. This dependency could have a slower time course and may be more persistent than state-dependent effects in visual cortex, yet it may obey the same rules. Identifying general principles of information processing in the brain is the major goal of systems and cognitive neuroscience. We believe that our proposal makes several steps in that direction.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Texas Health Science Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020083\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '452,353', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The paper addressed an apparently simple question: how many phone lines a company needs to the outside world? Consider an institution with 2000 employees, each with a phone on its desk. If all employees were to call outside at the same time, the institution would need 2000 lines to serve them all. In reality, however, only a small fraction of the employees talk at any given moment. Erlang made the assumption that the chance that we are on the phone in a given moment has a fixed probability, concluding that if everybody talks on average for two minutes with probability 1/30, only 87 lines are sufficient. Today engineers use Erlang's formula each time they install a new phone system or design a wireless antenna for mobile phones in a neighborhood.  Erlang's formula is based on the simple but widely held assumption that the events taking place in society and nature are uniformly distributed in time, well described by Poisson processes. This means that my chance of making a call in the next five minutes is the same as in a five minute interval two hours from now. Rate equation models of reactions assume that molecules in a cell bump into each other at a uniform rate. The spread of viruses is modeled under the assumption that an infected person's probability to pass on the virus to a healthy individual follows a Poisson process. The bandwidth of Internet routers is determined using the assumption that our emails are sent at a uniform rate. Yet, recently there is increasing evidence that the timing of events in complex systems is far from being uniform. For example, we send several emails in close succession, followed by long periods of no email activity. Seabirds fly long stretches between rapid burst of fishing patterns. Intensive burts of earthquakes are followed by long quiet periods. Thus for all practical purposes . It matters things happen.  The observed inhomogeneous time distributions indicate a fundamental lack of understanding of what determines the timing of events in a complex system. We tend to believe that molecules in the cell react in an unpredictable fashion, that people spontaneously engage in conversations or that a computer virus spontaneously spreads to other users. But . Bacteria in a glucose rich environment cannot create a fructose-6-phosphate molecule until glucose-6-phosphate has been has been synthesized. You will not make that phone call or send that email until you have all the information for the communication. In most complex systems events are highly interdependent, and this interdependency drives their timing as well.  The questions we plan to ask during this research are apparently simple: Are there laws that govern the timing of events taking place in complex systems? What are the fundamental limits of event predictability? To answer them we plan to study three classes of systems, offering an increasing range of challenges and research opportunities. We first plan to focus on designed systems, like a computer chip or a software package, whose internal dynamics is fully deterministic, but whose activity patterns are driven by external inputs with unknown nature. Extensive datasets capturing the time dependent activity of millions of gates and the activity patterns of several large software packages will allow us to study the nature of time and predictability in designed systems using a combination of empirical and modeling tools. Second, we will focus on human activity patterns, as recorded by anonymized telephone, email and web browsing records, allowing us to explore the coupled activity of millions of individuals over considerable time frames. The wealth of the available empirical data will allow us to uncover the universal statistical signatures of event timing. The experience we gain from exploring these well mapped designed and social systems will be used to study the timing of the molecular events within the cell, focusing on selected regulatory pathways whose reaction parameters and mechanisms are known. Current advances in fluorescent microscopy that can capture reactions at the single molecule level offer hope that the predictions we develop can be experimentally tested.  While predicting the timing of events may sound like science fiction, in reality our goal is somewhat more limited: we are not planning to predict events of unknown nature, but focus only on events that are known to take place with some regularity in a given system. In this respect the real challenge is to develop the tools to approach the timing of events in a systematic fashion. A successful research program in this direction could take complexity research into a new direction, moving from the static network based approaches that have dominated our thinking about complex systems in the past five years to uncovering what is going on in real systems, and understanding how the components of the system are utilized and activated in time to generate the observed complex behavior.  We often think of complex systems as networks whose links support material or information flow. Yet, given the small copy number of transcription factors in a cell, this flow picture is highly unrealistic and should be replaced by rarely occurring molecular interactions. Similarly, the strong ties characterizing social or professional networks in reality represent the sum of brief communications. How do we rethink complexity to take into account the discreteness of the individual events? How do we approach the nature of time in a complex system? While today these questions are rarely asked, I believe that they will dominate our thinking about complexity in the coming decade. It is the goal of the research proposed here to lay the scientific groundwork for such thinking, potentially impacting a number of fields that regularly deal with complexity, from human dynamics to cell biology.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Notre Dame', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020084\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '439,808', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Our goal is to use mathematical modeling to predict the true extent of the tumor given the limited information provided by standard clinical imaging. The implications of this type of modeling would be of considerable broad interest to the neuron-oncology community. It is clear to us that truly revolutionary research to improve the humbling prognosis of gliomas cannot proceed without knowledge of the interactions of the two most salient features of their progression – migration and net proliferation! This can be most efficiently done by mathematical modeling that allows for iterative comparisons between virtual and real situations providing direction for experimental designs in testing new hypotheses. We propose validating and extending our relatively simple mathematical model to define these two most basic characteristics, net proliferation and dispersal, in each patient. We have already successfully predicted the behavior of groups of patients, both low-grade and high-grade, and believe that the extension to individual patients would permit much more rapid identification of successful new therapies, conceivably also correlated with molecular analyses (genetic or proteomic) that can be expected to be practically unique for each patient. Our model can be applied to an individual patient to calculate the two factors (proliferation and infiltrative potential) precisely enough to display the past, present and future distributions of tumor cell concentrations down to the individual cell, well beyond the ”edge ”of the tumor defined by current imaging. From the steepness of the gradient of glioma cells beyond the detectable tumor margin, the model provides information regarding the expected locations of potential recurrence, as well as the time scale on which we expect that regrowth to happen. These displays should provide guidance to surgeons, radiotherapists and neuro-oncologists as to where and when to expect recurrences. Not only should these predictions help them to define where to concentrate their respective treatments, but also comparison of the actual and predicted times to recurrence should also help to ascertain the effectiveness of treatments in individual patients, thereby, avoiding the necessity to use large groups of patients and averages as would be typical in most clinical trials. Our modeling approach establishes a new way of thinking about gliomas and has many applications, in the clinic as well as in the laboratory. Clearly, it is necessary to develop better treatment protocols that more directly address the diffuse nature of gliomas. However, since standard imaging technologies cannot define the diffusiveness of gliomas, there is essentially no means of assessing the efficacy of such a diffuse treatment regime without a quantitative (complex systems) model to interpret the available patient data. With our model for the basic biological mechanisms involved in brain tumor progression, limited patient data can be combined to develop a more thorough picture of the tumor’s past history and future behavior. Although this tool has implications for clinical care, we see this as a necessary step to remedy the present bottleneck in the development of novel and effective treatments for gliomas. With an easy-to-use computational interface to our mathematical model, new strategies can be tested virtually (i.e. in the model) to assess their potential impact and either pursued more carefully or rejected. Eventually we hope that the modeling framework will be seen as so successful as to be used to test new treatment strategies in vivo, with fewer real test patients and on a shortened time scale than a standard clinical trial since each patient can serve as his/her own control. We believe that this model will considerably improve the management of individual patients. Clinicians routinely question the efficacy of a given treatment at any given treatment and, to date, have very few tools for assessing treatment response in real time. Under the current treatment paradigm, glioma patients are considered to have failed a new treatment protocol if their imaging abnormality (T1gad for enhancing gliomas) has increased by at least 25%. In many GBM patients, this could translate to 3 months of practically untreated growth when an ineffective therapy is being administered. As new experimental therapies (radio and chemo) are introduced, an early and robust measure of effect is necessary in individual patients. These problems are compounded for those therapies that target molecular changes that only a subset of tumors will have and others not have, since tissue sampling may not be available in all. Our mathematical model provides a means to enhance the interpretation of current imaging techniques using existing standard sequences (T1Gd and T2) without the necessity of developing new acquisition sequences. Although new imaging techniques are being developed continuously and can be incorporated into our model, it seems highly unlikely that any technique will reach to the level of the single invading cell in practice. It is for this reason that we feel mathematical modeling has a significant place in the analysis of present and future imaging techniques as well as a broader role in the development of effective treatment stratgeies for patients with gliomas.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Washington', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2006', 'amount': '330,970', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

It is estimated that 5.5 million HPV infections arise annually in the US alone. HPV is the primary cause of cervical carcinoma, which is in turn the second most common malignancy among women and a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. HPV is also associated with genital warts in both females and males. Prophylactic HPV vaccines will be available soon. Vaccination has recently been advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an integral strategy for reducing the public health burden of HPV. The CDC currently recommends vaccination of young women only. However, the feasibility of optimal community vaccination depends on population adherence. The utilities (or values) of vaccination decisions to individuals and to their communities are governed by the interplay between two complex systems: epidemiological systems and social systems. We will quantitatively and experimentally assess the interaction between disease transmission and social decision-making, with specific application to HPV infection and vaccination decisions. We will determine h ow epidemiological complexity affects decision-making. In turn, we will explore how aggregate decision making influences a complex biological system. We propose to take an interdisciplinary approach that combines epidemiology, mathematical modeling, economics and game theory, in addition to model parameterization and verification from experimental and psychological data. We will define policies that encourage adherence to optimal vaccination strategies for the community-wide control of HPV. When vaccination is voluntary, medical decisions are made by individuals. Collectively, individual decisions determine the level of population immunity and thus the magnitude of an epidemic. Vaccination protects not only the people who are vaccinated, but others in the community who are thereby less likely to become infected. Conversely, when people choose not to be vaccinated, they not only take on a risk to themselves, but also put others at risk. In the case of HPV, the risks for the two sexes are different: women have much greater incentives to vaccinate than men. HPV vaccination confers protection against cervical cancer for women, whereas men receive protection against the much less grave condition of genital warts (in the case of the Merck vaccine) or even no personal incentive (in the case of the SmithKline Beecham vaccine). Consequently, if men are not vaccinated, they take on relatively small personal risk, but they cause a risk to their sexual partners directly and to the community indirectly. We will integrate results from models and experiments that capture both individual- and population-scale dynamics. On an individual scale, questionnaires and experimental game studies will be conducted to examine how an individual's vaccination decisions are influenced by the decisions of others, and to estimate the influence of altruism on vaccination decisions. Combining individual and population scales of analysis, we will combine a game-theoretic model of gender-specific vaccine demand with a model of HPV epidemiology, parameterized and verified with results from our questionnaire and experimental game studies. Our integration of these scales of analysis will facilitate the development of public health policies that take into account barriers to population adherence, and delineate the importance of such adherence in reducing HPV prevalence and cervical cancer. Most vaccination decision models have been formulated from a purely economic or sociological perspective, while studies from the public health perspective have not addressed the temporal dynamics of disease transmission. Conversely, e pidemiological models usually ignore economic constraints and incentives that are fundamental to the successful application of public health programs. A burgeoning area in which applied mathematical models can play a significant role is in addressing questions of the game-theoretic determinants of health outcomes. In a game-theoretic context, individuals are strategists who strive to maximize their expected utility, defined as the value of anticipated benefits minus the cost of anticipated risks. Indeed, survey data indicates that individuals attempt to do this, within the constraints of their knowledge and perceptions. We have previously formulated the conflict between individual and group interest as a population game, and have shown that the pursuit of self-interest can lead to suboptimal vaccination coverage for a community. The benefit to an individual of vaccination drops as the system approaches herd immunity, a level of community vaccination at which a disease would be eradicated. However, classical game theoretic models assume that individuals are perfectly rational and have complete knowledge. The next challenge is to parameterize epidemiological game theory models with empirically collected psychological data to include perceptions and attitudes about vaccination that differ from reality. For example, people tend to over-estimate risks of adverse effects of vaccines. We propose to conduct the first application of epidemiological game theoretic modeling to HPV vaccination policy. To achieve this objective, we will incorporate a model of HPV transmission into a game-theoretic framework that calculates the utilities to an individual dependent on their gender and on the strategies adopted by the rest of the population. We will compare group-optimal strategies versus individual-optimal strategies for HPV vaccination implementation, and the potential public health repercussions of imperfect adherence. This model will be applied to survey and experimental data designed specifically to parameterize and verify the model. We will propose ways in which population adherence to group-optimal public health policies can be enhanced. We will investigate two important sources of discrepancies that affect vaccination levels. Firstly, there are discrepancies generated by the discordance of incentives between women and men to vaccinate. Secondly, there are discrepancies caused by differences between perception and reality of HPV epidemiological parameters. The early history of game theory, as developed by John von Neumann and others from the 1920's to the 1940's focused on 2-person games where the winnings of one player were the losses of the other player. In 1950, John Nash radically expanded the scope of game theory.  He developed game theory with 3 or more players and introduced the idea of a \"Nash equilibrium\", which is now a central tool in contemporary microeconomic theory.  At a Nash equilibrium, no individuals can increase their utility by switching to a different strategy. However, an individual’s utility at the Nash equilibrium is not necessarily optimal for the individual or for the community. Cooperation may generate a higher utility, but may not be socially stable, because an individual can increase his utility by ‘defecting’ – in the vaccination case, refusal to vaccinate is a defection. Calculating Nash equilibria for heterogeneous (in our case gender-structured) populations is challenging because it requires simultaneously determining the best response strategy for every heterogeneous group, dependent upon overall population behavior. Thus, w e will develop an algorithm for determining Nash equilibria of vaccination behavior governed by self-interest, in addition to utilitarian vaccine allocation strategies. We will identify the parameters that have the greatest impact on aligning individual-optimal and group-optimal vaccination strategies, such as attitudes toward vaccine efficacy, cost and risk. To determine the likely influence of improving dissemination of information about HPV and its vaccine, we will compare actual parameter values with perceived parameter values, the latter of which will be obtained from our psychological data. To examine how an individual's vaccination decisions are influenced by the dynamics of disease transmission and aggregate vaccination behavior, we will conduct a questionnaire studies and experimental games. Interdependent social and epidemiological dynamics have been unrecognized in previous questionnaire studies of vaccination decisions. Our interdisciplinary collaboration will equip us to take into account these complex dynamics. These studies will quantify the extent to which people accurately estimate the relative risks and costs of HPV vaccination compared to the illness itself. We will assess how the behavior of others and concern for others HPV vaccination decisions. We will use our empirical results to parameterize our game theoretic model of vaccination and predict discrepancies between collective individual behavior and the societal utilitarian strategy. Our results will be applicable to other social decision-making contexts in which costs and benefits must be evaluated and the behavior of others taken into account. Ultimately, policy makers must balance health, social, economic, ethical and political considerations when developing optimal public health policies. Our aim is to inform vaccine allocation and adherence promotion strategies that minimize the public health burden of HPV. Our interdisciplinary approach combines the development of theoretical models with psychological data collection and parameterization, economics with epidemiology, and individual decision making with population-level public health outcomes. The development of game theoretic models and parameterization will be useful for studying vaccination dynamics of other infectious diseases; to the further application of game theory to population dynamics, psychology and health; and to public policy in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Yale University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020114\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '444,902', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Math has become an invaluable tool in the fight against infectious diseases. It allows public health officials to conduct virtual experiments that would be practically unfeasible or unethical. Controlled experiments, in which one population receives an intervention and the other does not, are impossible as we clearly cannot intentionally introduce disease into populations or withhold potentially lifesaving efforts for the sake of scientific study. Mathematical models provide a way around this difficulty. In the 18th century, Daniel Bernoulli made simple calculations that precipitated the eradication of smallpox from Europe and William Farr used statistics to discover that cholera spread via water rather than air, leading to more effective control measures. In the 20th century, mathematical epidemiology exploded and contributed to the prediction and control of almost every disease plaguing humans and their agriculture. While we can effectively prevent or control many of the diseases we know well, we struggle when new ones appear or old ones evolve. Animal pathogens (zoonotics) regularly jump into human populations. In 1918, a new and highly virulent strain of avian flu notoriously moved into humans, killing over 20 million people. Later in the 20th century, HIV crossed from chimpanzees into humans, and has since claimed over 25 million human lives. In the last five years alone, we have caught SARS from civet cats, monkeypox from Gambian rats, Ebola from fruit bats, West Nile from mosquitos that fed on infected birds, hantavirus from deer mice, and possibly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease from eating cattle with mad cow disease. The diverse evolutionary patterns of pathogens are puzzling. Why do some zoonotic diseases adapt to humans while others do not? Why does HIV evolve too quickly for us to develop an effective vaccine whereas flu evolves moderately, requiring the annual redevelopment of new vaccines, and measles is so stagnant that we are still protected by a vaccine developed in the 1960’s? How does our own behavior influence these evolutionary patterns? My work is at the intersection of evolutionary biology and epidemiology. I use mathematics to study the complex interplay between mutation, natural selection and disease transmission that leads to the rapid evolution of pathogens. This project addresses two important factors that contribute to ability of a pathogen to evolve: the mutations that fuel its evolution and the host conditions that force it to evolve. (1) : Mutations can mean the proliferation or demise of a virus. From the perspective of the virus, good mutations can be the key to avoiding recognition by the host immune system or evading therapeutic intervention, while bad ones can be fatal. From our perspective, forecasting such mutations can be the key to developing effective controls—both vaccines that can withstand pathogen evolution and antiviral therapies that, by increasing the frequency of mutations, cause a mutational meltdown of the virus. Although evolutionary theory says much about the fate of a mutation once it arises, it says nothing about the spectrum of mutations that will arise in the first place. Some mutations will make the organism more fit, others will harm or even kill the organism, and others still will have little if no effect on the essential functions of the organism. One can think of genes as being points in a vast network of all possible genes, connected together by mutations that convert one gene to another. Organisms evolve by moving along the edges of this network. Random mutations push out in all directions, while natural selection confines the population to edges that maintain or increase fitness. To better understand the spectrum of mutations that drive evolution and the puzzling differences in the evolutionary propensities of viruses, we will build biologically realistic models of the mutational networks that underlie the evolution of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules. RNA is an essential molecule, which plays a critical role in protein synthesis and serves as the genetic material for RNA viruses like HIV, influenza and measles. By analyzing these networks and developing statistical methods for inferring the structures of more complex mutational networks, we will gain basic insight into the evolutionary patterns of viruses. This will allow us to explain why some viruses can evolve more quickly than others, to forecast mutations that might arise in the future, and to develop more robust vaccines and therapies. (2) : We will also study how our own behavior—our contact patterns and public health interventions—constrains the evolution of pathogens. Contact patterns can vary significantly from person to person. Nurses and doctors have much higher numbers of close physical contacts each day than do infants and retirees. The number and nature of interpersonal interactions determine one’s risk of catching a disease and one’s likelihood of further spreading the disease. Yet the most widely used mathematical models for predicting the spread of disease largely ignore diversity in contact patterns, and thus are unable to provide satisfactory answers to some important public health problems. Over the last five years, I have been working with an international team of epidemiologists, public health officials, and physicists to develop powerful methods for predicting and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. The first step in this approach is to build a model of the network of human contacts that can lead to disease transmission. For example, we have modeled contact networks within schools, prisons, hospitals, cities and the entire US. The second step is to use mathematical methods to predict the spread of disease through the community and to evaluate the efficacy of various forms of intervention. Our recent research has suggested more effective measures for controlling pneumonia in health care settings, containing outbreaks of respiratory-borne infections in cities, vaccinating populations against influenza, and preventing long-range transmission of diseases via air travel. We will extend this approach to study the complex relationship between contact network structure and pathogen evolution. Consider influenza. The spread of flu hinges on the structure of the underlying contact network. After infection, an individual will initially be immune to re-infection. The contact network will therefore thin out over the course of a flu season, as infections effectively remove individuals from future transmission. This change will impede future outbreaks. The flu virus, however, is continually evolving through a process called . In any given year, the circulating strains may be immunologically distinct from past strains, and can thus re-infect some or all individuals that were previously infected. The fate of a new strain will depend on the residual structure of the host contact network, that is, the contacts patterns between individuals who remain partially or completely susceptible to the new strain. Using realistic contact network models for hospitals and cities, we will study the impacts of host contact patterns on pathogen evolution and vice versa. This will enable us to predict the spread of mutant strains, develop vaccination strategies that complement disease-induced immunity already present in the population, and modify our behavior to discourage the evolution of harmful strains. These investigations are part of our broader research program to study the complex mutational processes and host demographics that fundamentally steer pathogen evolution.

The proposal has two nested goals. The broader objective is to tackle one of the fundamental questions in the field: What are the units of correspondence between cognitive function and brain function. The specific objective is to develop a new experimental paradigm to investigate the nature of mental representations and our ability to orient attention to their selective attributes. Mapping cognitive functions onto brain functions Human cognitive neuroscience is a long-awaited butterfly, just taking flight. People have scratched their heads for thousands of years trying to link what was inside mentally with what was inside physically. Recent methods that measure brain activity non-invasively have boosted significantly the scientific investigation of the human mind. Positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging detect changes in blood flow that follow increased metabolic demands; and reveal the brain regions that participate during a behavioral task. They provide maps of brain activity with high anatomical resolution at the brain-region scale, but with poor temporal resolution. Recordings of electrical or magnetic potentials associated with perceptual, cognitive or motor events are useful for testing the reactivity of the brain to experimental variables. Though poor in spatial resolution, recordings have real-time resolution and the sensitivity to capture brief changes in neural activity. Convergent findings from imaging and recording methods can build a dynamic view of the distributed neural systems that achieve cognitive functions. The picture is macroscopic. Methods in human cognitive neuroscience provide little or no information about the computations or mechanisms that take place at the levels of molecules, single cells, or local cellular micro-circuitry within brain regions. Nevertheless, they have the power to address one of the most fundamental questions about brain and cognition - the nature of their mapping. Much of our vision of cognition is still influenced by folk psychology and introspection. We divide cognition into common-sense domains of perception, attention, memory, language, etc. Scientific experimentation often respects these domain boundaries. Research fields within domains develop their own vocabulary and theories. There is an implicit assumption that the mapping of cognition onto neural function also obeys these domain boundaries. If so, there would be distinct brain circuits responsible for functions within perception, attention, memory, language, etc. This view is a modern version of phrenology - with less elaborate categories of cognitive functions, and neural circuits substituting for brain regions. But what if common sense leads us astray from the true fabric of cognition? (For example, physics is leading us to a remarkably weird view of the nature of physical reality.) Instead of being bound by cognitive domains, brain areas may contribute particular functions that are useful for multiple cognitive domains. Some evidence for the sharing of brain areas across domains already exists. For example, associative visual areas in inferior temporal cortex have been shown to participate in perception [1], attention [2], and long-term associative memory [3]. Mapping between cognitive functions and brain functions therefore might require re-thinking the elemental functional units of cognition. New building blocks might well lead to a radically different overall picture of cognition, far away from the armchair. Instead of being restricted to dedicated phrenological circuits, the brain may be able to assemble different types of complex circuits from a variety of simple functional \"lego\"-blocks according to the behavioral demands. The proposed research examines one potential building-block cognitive function across the boundaries of perception, working memory and long-term memory. The cognitive function is that of orienting attention voluntarily to a specific aspect of a representation. Attentional orienting is one of the basic executive control functions. It involves the ability to tune in at will to an anticipated aspect of stimulation. The best studied example is that of spatial orienting. If an event occurs at the expected location, we can detect it or make decisions about it much more quickly and accurately [4]. We can move attention to spatial locations independently from making eye movements. So far, attentional orienting has been investigated within the perceptual domain, using largely a paradigm developed by Posner [4]. Essentially, an informative cue predicts the likely location of an upcoming event, which the participant must detect or identify. I hope to extend the investigation into the domains of working memory and long-term memory. The proposal introduces new experimental tasks in which informative retro-cues predict the likely location of an item in a past stimulus array or scene. The rationale is simple. We optimize perception according to our expectations and what is relevant. It is likely that we can also optimize our access to mental representations in the same way, whether these are representations that we hold on-line from vanishing perception (working memory) or the that we summon from the slumbering memories formed in the past (long-term memory). Investigation of attentional orienting to these two types of mental representations as well as to perception will reveal whether neural circuits that achieve orienting are separate for the different domains or whether they share a common structure. The finding that this elementary function of cognitive control is not domain-specific will challenge the neo-phrenological dogma that cognitive domains have independent organization in the brain. Mental representations and voluntary orienting Investigation of attentional orienting to mental representations also provides a tool for probing the nature of mental representations . Mental representations are the templates of our internal mental world. Their nature is notoriously difficult to investigate, given the lack of direct or objective measures of their contents. Though mental representations may have their origins in the energies of the external world, they may also be highly constructed, abstracted or distorted interpretations. Furthermore, the nature of mental representations may change over time. An event in the world is transformed into a perception. After it passes away, it is thought to leave a high-fidelity representation. In the case of a visual image, this is known as an iconic memory. In less than a second, the iconic memory either is lost or becomes actively maintained in consciousness as working memory. With time and interference, the working memory falls out of consciousness. At some later point, it may be possible to retrieve the event, whose representation has become consolidated in long-term memory The details of how perceptions evolve into long-term memories are not at all well worked out. The favored idea is that there are different types of mental representations: iconic, working-memory, and long-term memory. For example, standard theoretical models propose separate neural stores for these different types of representations [6-7]. However, a simple and feasible alternative is that mental representations are formed and maintained within the brain areas directly involved in perception and action [7], without any need for additional independent stores. Representations and processing are bundled within the perceptual-motor information-processing systems much in the way as in connectionist networks [8]. Integration of distinct aspects of mental in working memory and in long-term memory appear to involve additionally associative brain areas, which do not store any information themselves, but which bridge between and coordinate activity in perceptual-motor systems [9-11 ]. In this view, mental representations may change gradually and continually over time through elaboration and consolidation mechanisms, perhaps without any major discontinuities. Attentional orienting studies will first determine whether access to specific aspects of mental representations is under voluntary control in the same way as access to aspects of perceptual representations. Previous work has suggested that search for items in working memory proceeds through a rigid automatic serial and exhaustive process [12]. The selective control over access to long-term memory has not been tested directly. Finding that we can use informative retro-cues to enhance access to mental representations will be a breakthrough, showing that mental representations are flexible. Significant differences in the ability to orient attention to iconic, working or long-term memories would suggest different natures of these representations. In contrast, similar effects of attentional orienting would favor a common makeup. Brain imaging and recording experiments will reveal the functional anatomy and neural dynamics involved in accessing mental representations of different durations, to examine the degree of overlap versus specificity directly. The success of the approach will open doors to investigating what types of predictive information facilitate access to memories of different durations (e.g., location, features, objects, object categories, etc), and therefore what types of information are coded and relevant in mental representations. Learning about the nature of mental representations will not only shed light on one of the longstanding mysteries about cognition, it may also have concrete practical implications for everyday life. We should be able to exploit voluntary orienting of attention to improve our mental capacity. References: 1. Gross, C. G. (1992). Representation of visual stimuli in inferior temporal cortex.

Over the past two decades, we and many others have reported that the mature brain continues to harbor a population of neural stem cells, multipotential and self-renewing cells that persist from early development 6,16,33-37. In the adult forebrain, these cells remain in a discrete layer, the subependyma, which lines the lateral ventricles. The adult brain also harbors a number of different types of more restricted progenitor cells, that can give rise to new neurons and glial cells, the latter including the two major glial cell types, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Whereas mature human neurons and oligodendrocytes are incapable of further cell division, the stem and progenitor cells that give rise to them can divide throughout life. These precursor cells thus appear likely candidates as sources for primary tumors of the central nervous system10. This may be especially true in children, in whom periventricular tumors predominate. But even in adults, in whom glial tumors are much more common, tumors may arise from resident glial progenitor cells of the tissue parenchyma, rather than from mature glial cells. In this proposal, we seek to use a genetic strategy of promoter-based selection to isolate stem and progenitor cells from different stage-defined adult glial tumors, in order to study the biology and genomics of the neoplastic progenitors from which these tumors arise. In studies of the past 7 years, we have used fluorescent reporter genes placed under the control of progenitor cell-specific promoters to identify and then isolate neural stem cells24, neuronal progenitors2,3, as well as parenchymal glial progenitor cells4,5, from both fetal and adult human brain tissues. Recently we have extended this analysis to CNS tumors, for the purpose of isolating stem and progenitor cells from tumors, as a first step towards understanding how these cells differ in their biology and gene expression from normal, non-neoplastic adult progenitor cells. Our pilot studies thus far have included neurocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed oligo-astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma, and have proven both encouraging and fundamentally exciting: Using promoter-based selection, we have now been able to extract neoplastic progenitors from each of these tumors, that correspond to ontogenetically-analogous progenitors in the normal brain. This has allowed us to begin comparing the gene expression patterns of these tumor stem cells to their native, non-transformed analogues. In our first formal validation of this strategy, we used Affymetrix arrays to compare the gene expression profile of neurocytoma, a predominantly pro-neuronal tumor of the ventricular wall, to that of the normal adult subependyma, as well as to that of neural progenitor cells sorted from normal brain on the basis of nestin enhancer-specified, GFP-based FACS. We found that this analysis revealed a discrete and relatively small set of highly differentially expressed genes in the neurocytoma cells relative to normal ventricular zone and its nestin-selected progenitors22. Among the differentially expressed genes, the growth hormone IGF2 and its downstream signal intermediates were prominent; indeed, their selective overexpression was quantitatively remarkable: qPCR confirmed a >50-fold increase in IGF signal components in neurocytoma cells compared to native subependymal progenitors, despite substantially overlapping expression patterns otherwise. Immunocytochemistry and Western analysis confirmed high IGF2 expression levels by neurocytoma, and pathway analysis using Ingenuity confirmed the differential transcriptional activation of the IGF2 signaling pathway. We are now in the midst of testing IGF2 antagonists to assess their therapeutic potential in these tumors. Yet whether IGF2 signal inhibition is found to be a potential treatment strategy in neurocytoma or not, the value of this strategy of comparing the expression profiles of tumor progenitors to their sorted native homologues, as a means of rapidly and efficiently identifying potentially causal genes in neural tumor formation, and in identifying the causal stem or progenitor cell in a given heterogeneous cancer, now seems clear. In this proposal we seek to follow this approach in assessing adult glial tumors, with the goal of identifying those genes associated with the transformation of a native glial progenitor into a glioma. Using progenitor cell isolates specifically extracted from human astrocytomas, oligodendroglioma, and mixed astrocytoma-oligodendrogliomas, we will first identify which are actually tumorigenic, by transplanting each promoter-defined isolate into naïve immunodeficient mice to establish which progenitor isolates are able to initiate tumors, and what types of tumors are generated by each purified phenotype. We will then test the possibility that by subtracting the gene expression profile of normal, native progenitors from that of their tumor-derived counterparts, we can identify those genes that are specifically dysregulated in tumor progenitors. In particular, for each of the glial progenitor cell types to be investigated, we expect to identify those genes overexpressed by tumorigenic vs. normal progenitors, and then use this information to predict those signaling pathways differentially active in the tumor progenitors. We thereby hope to identify a discrete cohort of genes and pathways that distinguish each tumor progenitor cell type from its counterpart in normal brain. The importance of defining those genes and signaling pathways that distinguish the transformed progenitors of brain tumors from the native progenitor cells from which they derive is manifold. The different phenotypes of human brain tumors may comprise a hierarchy of neoplastic progenitor cells, with distinct tumors corresponding to the transformed derivatives of cells transformed at distinct points in their lineage progression. As a result, the daughter cells of transformed progenitor cells may be sufficiently distinct from their parents in both their expansion and growth control, that therapy directed at their derivative tumors may be neither appropriate nor effective against the parental transformed progenitor clone. Of note, this differs from the tumor stem cell hypothesis, which would argue that abolition of the parental progenitor, or tumor stem cell, would be sufficient to destroy a given tumor, whose derivative phenotypes would be incapable of self-renewal. Rather, we suggest that derivative phenotypes may well be capable of autonomous self-renewal once generated, but that cytotoxic therapy directed against them, without abolition of their underlying parental transformant, is destined for relapse and ultimate treatment failure. The therapeutic implication is that oncolytic therapy may need to be directed not solely at either the tumor stem cell or its derivatives, but rather at both, through fundamentally different mechanistic strategies. By the strategies outlined in this proposal, we hope to efficiently develop anti-neoplastic strategies directed specifically at genes critical to the growth and survival of tumor stem cells. By separately targeting tumor stem cells and their daughter cells with mechanistically distinct agents, we hope to minimize the likelihood of clinical relapse after initial treatment of malignant glioma. By so doing, we hope to provide clinical benefit to a patient population whose prognosis remains as dire today as it was decades ago, long before the advent of the technologies and approaches that we now hope to bring to bear to the treatment of this disease.

In the standard model--the one found in most models of the nervous system--neural circuits compute the value of variables, given their input. For instance, in models of face recognition, neurons are thought to encode the identity of the person whose image appears on the retina. The key concept in this approach is that neural circuits return one answer in response to their input. The alternative, known as the Bayesian approach, is that neural circuits return many answers along with their respective probabilities. In other words, according to this view, neural circuits compute probability distributions over the variables of interest given the input. In the case of face recognition, a Bayesian inference would yield the probability over all possible names given the image. If a decision is needed, one can simply pick the name with the highest probability (other options are also available depending on the cost of mistakes). This might appear to be a minor modification to the standard approach, but it turns out to be a fundamentally different, and more efficient, approach. For instance, the Bayesian framework provides a natural way to combine multiple sources of information. Imagine locating an object that can be seen and heard simultaneously (for instance, a mosquito). Using the standard approach, one would first compute two estimates: one based on vision alone and one based on audition alone. The next step would be to combine those estimates together, by taking, for instance, the average of the two unimodal estimates. This may sound like the best way to proceed, but this is not the case; the average treats the two estimates on an equal footing which is a bad idea because vision and audition are not equally informative. In daylight, vision is much more reliable than audition (close your eyes and try locating a mosquito based on audition alone). It would therefore make sense to favor vision when combining the unimodal estimates. However, favoring vision at all times is not optimal either, because there are contexts in which audition is more reliable (e.g., at night). The standard approach does not naturally deal with this problem. By contrast, the Bayesian approach takes into account the reliability, or certainty of all cues automatically. It takes into account reliability because the computations operate over probability distributions, which explicitly encode certainty. Hence, if a visual cue is reliable, its probability distribution will tend to be narrowly peaked around a particular value. If the reliability decreases (as it would for a visual stimulus at night), the probability distribution becomes wider. In the case of visuo-auditory integration, the goal of the Bayesian inference is to compute the probability distribution over position given the visual and auditory inputs. This is obtained by simply multiplying the unimodal distributions together, i.e., the distribution over position given vision and the distribution over position given audition. Such a product is dominated by the distribution with the narrowest distribution, thus favoring the most reliable cue. The Bayesian approach also provides a natural framework for decisions making. Indeed, most decisions involves integrating a variety of factors, or evidence, in favor or against multiples alternatives, a process which is formally equivalent to the visuoauditory integration problem we have just described. Another major advantage of the Bayesian inferences is that it provides a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge. If for instance, an object has a tendency to appear in around the same location over time, this knowledge can be encoded in a prior probability distribution centered on that location. This prior can then be combined with the unimodal probability distribution by simply taking product of the distributions. All of these remarkable computational properties of Bayesian inference have led several investigators to ask whether some aspects of neural computation are akin to Bayesian inferences. As mentioned in the introduction, there is now a host of behavioral data indicating that humans use a Bayesian approach to solve a wide variety of problems [see for instance 2]. Our goal is to understand how neurons circuits in the cortex perform Bayesian inference. Our first challenge will to be to characterize the neural code used for representing probability distributions. At first sight, it would seem that cortical neurons are not particularly well suited to the encoding of probability distributions because their responses appear to be very unreliable. For instance, some neurons in the visual cortex respond selectivity to the image of a moving object. Their response however can vary greatly from trial to trial, even if the stimulus in the image moves with the very same speed and direction. This high level of variability is difficult to reconcile with the notion that the nervous system is often Bayes optimal. We believe however that variability is exactly what is expected from a system representing and manipulating probability distributions, or, to put it slightly differently, we believe that neurons are variable because they encode probability distributions. To see what led us to this idea, consider the following example. Imagine that we want to estimate the probability of getting head when flipping a coin. To estimate the probability, we can throw the coin, say, 100 times, count the number of heads, and divide by 100 to get the probability for head. For example, if we get 55 heads, we would conclude that the probability is 0.55. If we repeat this experiment a second time, we are very likely to get a different answer because of the random nature of the coin tossing. We may get for instance 47 heads, in which case we would now conclude that the probability is 0.47. If neurons encode probability distributions, they must go through a similar process. They get to observe a limited amount of data (the sensory signals) and they must infer the probability distribution that led to this data. Just like our estimate of the probability of head varies from trial to trial in our example, the response of neurons is bound to vary from trial to trial. This is the essence of our idea: the variability in neuronal responses is due to the fact that neurons represent probability distributions. Furthermore, we will show that by measuring this variability, we can decode the probability distribution encoded in a pattern of neural activity across a population of neurons. We call this kind of neural code probabilistic population codes. The next step in our project will be to determine how to combine probabilistic population codes to perform Bayesian inference. Our preliminary work indicates that the solution could be remarkably simple given the form of neuronal variability in the brain: inference simply require adding probabilistic population codes together. This is remarkable because summing is the simplest form of computation and it can be readily implemented in neural hardware. Once the theoretical foundations of our framework are laid out, we will test our theory by recording the activity of neurons in animals trained to make simple perceptual decisions. We think that this is a particularly interesting domain to examine given that decision making is one of the most critical functions of the human brain, impacting all aspects of our life on time scales extending from tenths of seconds to days. In summary, we believe that our project can provide a neural theory of Bayesian inference and simple decision making, while resolving one of the most puzzling paradoxes in neuroscience: how can behavior be near Bayesian optimal with seemingly unreliable neurons? This theory will have a wide range of applications, from sensory processing to motor control, and will be readily testable with the existing technologies for measuring neural activity. References 1.

An estimated 40 million people are currently infected with HIV, with 5 million new infections and 3 million deaths in 2001. Tuberculosis and malaria also continue to exact a huge toll, estimated at 1.7 million and 1 million deaths respectively each year. In the developed world, the spread of hepatitis C virus also poses a threat to public health, with an estimated 2.7 million Americans chronically infected. The spread of these diseases can be contrasted with the success of the campaign to eradicate polio, which is now nearing completion. The contrast between the devastation of HIV and the near eradication of polio provides a strong incentive to push forward development of a vaccine for HIV. Analysis of HIV vaccine studies in non-human primates suggest that within five to ten years it is likely that a human vaccine for HIV will emerge that produces at least some attenuation of disease in infected individuals. However, it appears unlikely that such a vaccine will resemble the more traditional vaccines we know to date. The HIV vaccines currently being developed are unable to prevent infection. Instead, they may simply reduce the severity of disease following infection. Therefore, a likely scenario is that one or more vaccines will emerge from phase III trials in the next 5-10 years, which stimulate the immune system and produce significant reductions in the concentration of virus. In an ideal study, these individuals would be followed for a decade or more to ascertain their long-term survival following infection, their viral load and their risk of transmitting the virus with time. However, given the urgency of delivering a vaccine of any sort, it seems unlikely that both scientists and the community will be prepared to wait the many years required to acquire this empirical data. In the absence of this data, how will it be possible to estimate the minimal vaccine effectiveness required to significantly reduce HIV transmission? Indeed, it is not even clear what measures of vaccine effectiveness are important for this estimation. If two competing vaccines show slightly different effects for example one decreasing the concentration of virus and the other more significantly slowing the rate of disease progression and delaying the time to AIDS - how will it be possible to estimate the relative long term benefits of the two? In order to assess the likely effectiveness of a vaccine it is necessary to understand both the effects of the vaccine on host immune responses and on viral evolution. The immune system employs a variety of mechanisms to fight infection, including 'helper' and 'killer' T cells, as well as B cells which produce antibody. The killer T cell response is thought to be most important in fighting HIV and most other chronic infections. None of the vaccines we presently use (against polio, measles etc) relies on these killer T cell responses. Most current vaccines against common illnesses depend on antibody to exert their protective effects. More importantly, our current vaccines are all against 'acute infections' - ones in which you get infected, become ill (or die), then completely eliminate the virus from you body and remain immune to re-infection for life. That is, exposure to these infectious agents - either through natural infection or vaccination - always lead to eradication of the virus and long-term immunity. This is in complete contrast to HIV and other chronic infectious diseases. In HIV it is unclear that anyone has ever eliminated the virus through natural immunity. It also seems that the immune response to HIV does not prevent re-infection some people may be infected with two different strains of HIV at different times. However, this does not mean that immune responses to HIV are useless. Some people infected with HIV manage to survive for decades without developing AIDS, probably due to a strong immune response. Similarly, as described above, vaccines in animals seem capable of delaying AIDS for substantial periods. Our current understanding of how the immune system controls HIV is very limited. We do understand, however, that the viral-immune interactions are very complex. The immune response targets small regions of the virus, and these regions can mutate and change to avoid this immune recognition. In fact, over the course of infection the immune system targets seem to constantly shift to new regions of the virus as the virus 'escapes' immune recognition of earlier sites. Some think that this constant 'race' between the immune system and virus - the virus escaping the immune response and the immune system fording new targets - eventually 'exhausts' the immune response. Since animal models suggest that vaccination can't prevent infection, perhaps the next best thing would be to slow down these cycles of 'escape'? However, in order to achieve this we must first understand the details of this immune-viral interplay. Developing a realistic model of immune responses to a virus can be done using techniques from complex systems theory and a computer simulation technique called 'lazy evaluation'. Killer T cells 'recognize' the virus through T cell receptor molecules on their surface. The body contains somewhere around a billion different T cells. These cells recognize different parts of the virus by the binding of different molecular shapes on the T cells to the molecules of the virus. These molecular interactions can be simulated on a computer by representing strings of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) as strings of numbers. When the molecules (represented as number strings) on a T cell complement the molecules of the virus (also represented as strings), then the T cells can divide and kill the virus. In infection, viruses can mutate by changing the amino acid sequences in their proteins. Similarly, the computer model allows for changes in the number strings representing the virus. It is extremely difficult to monitor all these cells in an infected individual. We are currently developing computer simulations that keep track of the number, specificity (region of the virus recognized) and activity of thousands of different T cells. Since HIV is also able to mutate rapidly, the model must also keep track of many different viral mutants. Such models make it possible to ask \"what if?\" questions about different approaches to vaccination, without having to resort to large scale trials in animals or humans. Different vaccination strategies that are predicted by the model to be likely candidates for success can then be trialed and the results fed back into the model to further optimize the analysis. The models just described help us predict the effects of a vaccine within an infected individual, but what about the effects of a vaccine within the population? An ideal vaccine not only has to allow infected individuals to live longer, it also has to reduce the transmission of the virus and therefore prevent new infections. To predict how well a vaccine might reduce the spread of HIV requires a different type of model - an epidemiological model - which tracks spread of the virus within the population. However, the dynamics of this model are very much dictated by the model of immuneviral interactions within individuals. For example, if vaccination reduces the concentration of virus in the blood of an individual, it will make it less likely that the virus will be transmitted. On the other hand, if the virus 'escapes' the immune response to vaccination in one person and this 'escape mutant' virus is transmitted to a second person, then the vaccine will have no protective effect (since the virus has already 'escaped' its response). The aim of any vaccination campaign is to maximize the survival of each infected individual and to minimize the number of new infections. This requires the combination of the immunological model of what happens within an individual, and the epidemiological model of what happens in a population. Optimizing all of these parameters simultaneously requires consideration of the multiple levels on which the virus operates - molecular, cellular, within an individual and within a population. Although we currently have some computer models which allow us to analyze the effects of virus on one of these levels or another, we do not have any models which incorporate the complexities of human-viral interaction. Without sophisticated models that incorporate all these aspects of a vaccine's effectiveness to help us predict likely outcomes of vaccination, we may either have to wait years to acquire the data through experimental observation - or risk mass administration of a vaccine without a full understanding of the likely outcome. Approaches to treatment of bacterial and viral infections in the past have often been based on little understanding of the long-term implications. The rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria and multi-drug resistant HIV provide salutary examples of how the usefulness of different weapons used in the fight against infectious disease can quickly be undermined. By the use of complex systems analysis of human-viral interactions it is hoped that we can avoid a similar situation occurring with future vaccines for HIV and other chronic infectious diseases.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of New South Wales', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002072\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Between us and everybody else on this planet. The president of the United States. A gondolier in Venice... It's not just the big names. It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people. - John Guare, The idea of the six degrees of separation?that you can get from anyone in the world to anyone else via a path of acquaintances only about six steps in length was introduced into popular culture with the words above, which come from John Guare's successful 1990 Broadway play, later made into a film. But the scientific result that underlies this idea, known as \"the small-world effect,\" is much older. In the 1960s, the influential experimental psychologist Stanley Milgram performed an ingenious experiment in which he sent letters to 160 subjects chosen at random (roughly speaking) from the population of Omaha, Nebraska. The instructions accompanying the letters were simple. Each subject was to try to get their letter to the same target person, a stockbroker friend of Milgram's who worked in Boston, Massachusetts. But there was a catch: they were only allowed to send the letter to someone they knew on a first-name basis. Since it was unlikely that they would know a Boston stockbroker, the best they could do was to send the letter to someone whom they felt would be closer to the target person in some social sense-maybe someone who lived in Massachusetts, or some who worked in the financial industry. Then that person would repeat the exercise, until, by a succession of jumps, the letter would, with luck, find its way into the hands of its intended recipient. Amazingly, 44 of Milgram's letters did reach the target. And the average number of steps they took to get there was just six. As the quotation above emphasizes, this result appears incredible to most of us. In a country with a population (at that time) of almost 200 million human beings, it took just six steps to get from one random person to another. Nonetheless, after many years and many other studies, we have found no reason to disbelieve Milgram's findings. It really is a small world. Milgram's experiment was one of the first results in the field of social networks. If we were to draw a map of our society in which people were represented as points, and pairs of points were joined by lines when the people in question knew one another on a first-name basis, the resulting network would be precisely the social network over which Milgram's letters were transmitted. Many other complex systems also take the form of networks. Human and animal societies, the Internet, roads, the power grid, telephone calls, the World-Wide Web, who works with whom, who sleeps with whom, and even the body's metabolism or the English language, can all be thought of as networks. My work is about studying the shapes of these networks, especially social networks. If we can understand the way people are connected to one another, then it will help us to understand also how information spreads, how diseases are communicated, how communities form, and how society changes over time. The work that my colleagues and I are doing has both experimental and theoretical components. We are interested in looking at actual networks in the real world and trying to determine their structure. Once we have gained some understanding of this structure, we use that information to construct mathematical and computer models of processes taking place on networks. Two examples demonstrate our approach. Infectious diseases are spread by physical contact between individuals. The pattern of who has contact with whom forms a network, but in many cases it is not easy to determine what the structure of this network is--a cold can easily be passed between two people who stand in line together at the bank or sit in adjacent rows at the movie theater. There are some cases, however, where the network can be measured. In particular, networks are often quite clear in institutional settings--schools, hospitals, barracks, retirement homes, and so forth. In one current study, performed in collaboration with scientists at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, we looked at an outbreak of walking pneumonia in a hospital in Evansville, Indiana. The network in this case consists of patients confined to wards and caregivers who each work in one or more wards. Constructing mathematical and computer models of this network, we simulated the progress of the outbreak through the hospital. Because of their movement between wards, we found that the caregivers were crucial to the spread of the disease, even though rather few of them contracted it. Based on these findings, we have been able to make new recommendations for controlling or preventing similar outbreaks in the fixture. Another study looks at the networks by which computer viruses spread. Although human and computer infections appear in many ways to be quite different, it turns out that they can be studied using similar mathematical tools. Computer viruses mostly spread via email: a virus arrives on a computer in an email message, and then finds further computers to infect by scrutinizing the recipient's email address book - computer file in which a user stores the email addresses of his or her frequent correspondents. These address books form a social network of connections between people, whose structure we can probe by looking at the address book files. Starting with such address book data, we have reconstructed a picture of this network and, as with the pneumonia study, have been able to create a mathematical model of the spread of computer viruses which allows us to make specific new recommendations for controlling and preventing virus infection. These are just two examples of the way in which the study of networks can help us understand how the world works and how specific problems can be solved. Other planned projects include studies of networks of collaboration between scientists and business-people, the structure of information networks such as the World-Wide Web and citation networks, and possibly networks of interaction between computer users in, for example, online auctions. Each of these has the potential to shed light on the forms of organization that societies choose and the way that organization affects the spread of information, be it scientific, professional, or personal. Theoretical analyses will include studies of the structure of sub-communities within larger networks, investigation of possible vaccination or other preventive strategies for contagion on human or computer networks, and studies of the structure of networks that grow and change over time, such as the Web. Under the program to be funded by this grant, we will pursue these and other projects to gain an understanding of how networks of connection between people and computers drive the actions of that most fascinating of complex systems, human society.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002070\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '408,113', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Satellite networks and communication systems allow essentially instantaneous access to data and images worldwide, fluctuations in Tokyo's financial markets are felt in New York and London, and overpopulation, pollution, deforestation, and global warming are widely recognized as everybody's problem. Social, economic, technological, and environmental systems are simultaneously becoming increasingly entangled and interconnected with each other. This globalization offers potential benefits including a higher standard of living, increased access to information, more sophisticated healthcare, and economic incentives to protect environmentally sensitive areas. Simultaneously, it carries potentially catastrophic risks associated with cascading failures which may propagate rapidly when systems are strongly interdependent and densely connected. Examples include delays in transportation and communications systems, as well as errant policies or technological blunders that initiate a whirlwind of economic, political, and environmental consequences. Of course, engineers and policy makers work extremely hard to design systems that will not break down, despite a great deal of uncertainty in the environment in which they operate and the components from which they are built. Few of us would get on an airplane if this were not the case. Simultaneously, we accept the fact that there are no guarantees. Similarly, biological evolution favors organisms which are tolerant to common variations in weather and nutrients. Selective pressure does little to protect advanced organisms against rare disturbances like large meteor impacts. The robustness architectures that stabilize systems and minimize propagation of damage are so dominant and pervasive that we often take them for granted. At their best, advanced technologies and organisms combine complicated internal networks and feedback loops with sloppy parts to create systems so robust as to create the illusion of very simple, reliable, and consistent behavior, apparently unperturbed by the environment. Nonetheless, failures occur. With increased connectivity there is the potential for increased social, economic, and environmental cost. Can anything be done to predict these events and mitigate their damage? A key insight comes from the observation that robustness involves tradeoffs between a broad spectrum of environmental influences that may initiate cascading failure events. Indeed, robustness can be viewed as the underlying mechanism leading to complexity. Complexity is not simply the number of component parts, but also the heterogeneity of components, and their organization into intricate networks. Robustness architectures dominate genomes for most organisms, and distinct part counts for modern technologies, and provide opportunities for higher fitness and/or performance because of the stability they create. This is the essence of the Highly Optimized Tolerance (HOT) theoretical framework linking robustness and complexity which I introduced recently with my collaborator, John Doyle. HOT describes systems fine-tuned for high performance, despite uncertainties in the environment and components. HOT's essential features include highly specialized, structured, hierarchical internal configurations, and robust, yet fragile external behavior. Fragilities arise when the very architectures that lead to robustness under one set of circumstances backfire leading to extreme sensitivity in other cases. One example is the automobile airbag, which protects passengers in high speed, head on collisions, but poses a danger to small children riding in the front seat, even under accidental low speed or stationary deployment. Another is the immune system which protects people from common colds and viruses, but occasionally backfires attacking an individual's own cells in auto-immune diseases. Such failure modes represent hypersensitivities which are intrinsically coupled to the robustness mechanism itself. While overall higher performance is achieved when the robustness architecture is included, under rare circumstances the outcome is worse than it would be if the architecture were not there at all. In many cases, this eventually leads to additional layers of complexity, as in the case of increasingly sophisticated airbag technologies involving sensors to estimate passenger size. Iteration of this process culminates in a complexity spiral, in which new features are developed to mitigate sensitivities associated with previous layers. Since robustness is created by very specific internal structures, when any of these systems is disassembled there is very little latitude to reassembly if a working system is expected. Even the rare cascading failure that is the fragile side of HOT complexity reveals only a limited glimpse of a system's internal architecture. Nonetheless, studying a system's robustness mechanisms provides a potential pathway to anticipating fragilities. HOT was developed initially using the models of statistical physics, modified to include a primitive form of robust design. Imagine your goal is to design a toy forest on a checkerboard landscape, where occupied sites correspond to trees, and vacancies correspond to firebreaks. Occasionally, a spark hits the forest due, e.g., to lightening, striking some locations more frequently than others. If it hits a tree, the fire burns through a connected cluster of neighboring trees. If your goal is to maximize the surviving yield of trees, what is the optimal strategy? While this is not a realistic model of forest management, it serves to illustrate the basic tradeoff between maximizing functionality under ideal circumstances (represented by high tree densities), and the need to devote resources (space) to robustness architectures which protect the system from a spectrum of disturbances. HOT configurations consist of compact, high density, cellular patterns of contiguous trees, separated by efficient, linear firebreaks. Optimal patterns are much more robust to fires than random configurations at similar densities, but are also extremely sensitive to changes in the spatial distribution of sparks, or flaws in the firebreak patterns. Under many circumstances, the robust, yet fragile nature of HOT systems leads to heavy tails or power law statistics in the frequency vs. size distribution of failure events. HOT has been successful in quantitatively describing statistics of forest fires, World Wide Web traffic, and electrical power outages. Heavy tails reflect tradeoffs in systems characterized by high densities and high throughputs, where many internal variables are tuned to favor small losses in common events, at the expense of large losses when subject to rare or unexpected perturbations, even if the perturbations themselves are infinitesimal. The research plan I developed in response to the James S. McDonnell Foundation's 21st Century Research Award for Studying Complex Systems extends the HOT framework linking complexity and robustness, and pursues applications in ecology, biology, engineering, and business. My objectives are loosely divided into four overlapping focus areas: (1) theoretical Foundations and unifying themes based on merging the perspectives of statistical physics and systems oriented mathematics from engineering, (2) applications in ecology and evolutionary biology aimed at exploring robustness in scenarios which are relevant to these fields, (3) development of models for robust network flow structure and evolution, with applications to the Internet, financial networks, and food webs, (4) detailed investigations of robustness, evolution, and human intervention in disturbance prone ecosystems, focusing on fires on terrestrial landscapes. HOT is motivated by biology and engineering, and builds on the mathematics of control, communications, and computing. While physics focuses primarily on universal properties of generic collections of isolated systems, control theory studies specific, often highly stylized systems in terms of their input vs. output characteristics. Control theory provides a mathematical framework for describing systems that are coupled to other systems, identifying sensitivities, and systematically determining the important internal variables for a system with particular objectives immersed in a variable environment. Suitably generalized, these techniques will be powerful, although currently their consequences outside of the controls community are largely unexplored. HOT provides an appealing base for the development of a broad framework for characterizing complex systems. Questions related to robustness, predictability, verifiability, and evolvability arise in a wide range of disciplines, and demand sharper definitions and new tools for analysis. If complex systems are intrinsically composed of extremely heterogeneous collections of objects, which are combined into intricate, highly structured networks, with hierarchies, and multiple scales, then HOT provides a means to develop a common ground between models, methods, and abstractions developed in different domains. Developing models of varying resolution, ranging from the tractable models on which the basic HOT framework is built, to complex, domain specific application models for technological, economic, ecological, and biological systems will connect our new tools with real world applications, and inspire new questions for theoretical consideration. The real test of a general framework for understanding complex systems is the extent to which it can provide new insights which generate future technologies, policies, medicines, etc.. This work has begun on several fronts and involves a spectrum of interdisciplinary collaborations. For the case of forest fires, with collaborators in geography I have developed a sophisticated new fire regime simulation environment to investigate fundamental properties of fire dynamics, and the long term effects of evolution and suppression on terrestrial landscapes.

When memory is lost ...we lose the ability to re-create our past, and as a result we lose our connection with ourselves and with others.\" (Squire and Kandel, 1999, p. ix). It is for these reasons that disturbances of memory have such profound effects on people's lives. Be it Alzheimer or Huntington disease, or any other of the injuries or diseases that can affect memory, memory impairment is very disabling and disruptive for both patients and their families. Questions about the nature of memory have been posed since antiquity. However, only at the end of the 19th century did inquiry move beyond clinical observation and philosophical discussion to become an experimental science. And only in the latter half of the 20th century, with the emergence of neuroscience, did it become possible to ask biological questions about how memory is acquired, organized and stored. In the 1950s, critical insights regarding the neuroscience of memory came from a patient who became known as H.M. At the age of 27 H.M. underwent surgery to remove the inner surface of the temporal lobes, including the hippocampus, in an attempt relieve severe epilepsy. Though this procedure did help his epilepsy, it also left him with a devastating memory impairment. The most salient feature of this impairment can be described as profound forgetfulness. Since the effects on memory of medial temporal lobe resection were described in patient H.M., a considerable body of work has been directed toward understanding how the hippocampus and related structures in the medial temporal lobe contribute to memory function. This work, which has focused especially on the hippocampus, has been carried out mainly in amnesic patients, monkeys, and rodents. One major fording is that the role of the hippocampus in memory is selective, in that it is involved in only one kind of memory (variously termed declarative, explicit, or relational). A phenomenon that has been especially important to this tradition of work is temporally-graded retrograde amnesia. Temporally-graded retrograde amnesia refers to the finding that (declarative) information learned long before the onset of memory impairment is often spared relative to information learned more recently. A good deal of progress has been made in understanding this phenomenon through neuropsychological testing of patients with brain damage. While studies of patients have improved the understanding of temporally-graded retrograde amnesia, it is difficult to study retrograde amnesia in patient populations for two reasons. First, studies with patients necessarily rely on retrospective methods and imperfect tests. Specifically, with retrospective tests, it is difficult to compare performance across past time periods because one cannot guarantee that the information from each time period has been learned to the same extent. Second, the most informative studies are those where detailed neuropathological and neuropsychological information have been obtained. However, the precise locus and extent of damage in amnesic patients is often difficult to determine eves with brain imaging techniques. Moreover, the damage seldom honors anatomical boundaries, so that structures in addition to the hippocampus are often damaged as well. These difficulties can be overcome by using experimental animals, where the locus and extent of damage can be precisely controlled and where the extent of learning can be carefully controlled by the use of prospective tests. Previous work in animals has relied on conventional (permanent) lesions made at different times before or after learning. Yet, the conventional lesion approach cannot identify the specific and unique times that a structure is important for function. It has been pointed out before that reversible lesion techniques have many advantages over the conventional lesion method. Indeed, reversible lesion techniques are now beginning to be developed and applied to the problem of memory using both pharmacological and genetic methods. I am proposing to study memory using a water-soluble version of CNQX (an AMPA/kainite antagonist), which can be introduced into the rat hippocampus by means of surgically implanted osmotic minipumps. The infusion can occur continuously for up to one week (or longer if a second pump is implanted). The fundamental questions I am asking are: exactly when relative to learning, storage, and retrieval is the hippocampus important for memory? Is it needed at the time of learning and for some limited time after learning? Would transient disruption of hippocampal function at any point during this interval impair retention? If the disruption is effective, does extending the period of disruption cause more severe disruption? If hippocampal neural activity is needed during the retention interval, is there also a requirement for NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity? Is there a fundamental difference between spatial and nonspatial memory? The studies I have proposed here, when completed, should provide important insights into when and how hippocampal function supports the establishment of long-term memory. Clarifying these issues is critical to understanding how memory is organized and stored in the brain. Improved understanding of the biology of memory should help in the development of preventions and treatments for conditions that affect memory. Though the use of animals to study memory is a powerful tool in and of itself, I believe it is critical to use what we know from studies of memory-impaired patients to guide our experiments with animals and to interpret the results obtained from studies of animals within the broader context of what we know from studies of humans. As an example, work with humans has suggested that hippocampal damage impairs declarative memory, that is, memory for facts and events. This impairment includes an impaired ability to remember the spatial layouts of previously encountered environments, but this spatial impairment is not a salient feature of the phenotype in humans. However, in the rat, the study of hippocampal function grew out of the study of spatial memory. For example, the discovery of place cells in the hippocampus (cells that predictably and reliably change their firing rates when a rat enters a specific area in an environment) was tremendously influential. Further work demonstrated that hippocampal damage in the rat profoundly impairs spatial memory. These results led to the idea that the hippocampus is responsible for forming and storing spatial maps of the environment, and many proposals about hippocampal function emphasize spatial cognition. Perhaps one reason why ideas about spatial memory in the rat have been so prominent is that spatial memory is readily trained and measured in the rat. Yet, there are now several different memory tests designed for the rat that measure nonspatial memory, and I have implemented a number of these tasks in my laboratory. Moreover, because I believe that tests of both spatial and nonspatial memory are critical for accurately assessing how the hippocampus functions, in the present proposal I have outlined studies of both spatial and nonspatial memory. In summary, I have proposed studies of memory and hippocampus in the rat as the first step in a new program of research that will study systematically the effects of reversible lesions. The work will be guided by what is known from work with humans and will attempt to address issues that are part of a long, and to some extent a polarized, tradition of work. In the sense that I am studying rodents but within an intellectual context that was developed from human cognition, I believe that the proposed work will be eminently useful for bridging brain, mind, and behavior.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - San Diego', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002077\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '441,434', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Unfortunately the outcome for adult patients with the most common intrinsic primary brain tumor, glioblastoma (WHO grade IV astrocytoma), continues to be extremely poor: even the most exciting advances provide only minimal improvement in median survival in clinical trials. Fundamental changes in our paradigm in the development of prognostic markers, imaging, and therapy must occur for real changes in patient outcome. To develop a new therapeutic model, incorporating lessons from another area of medicine, infectious disease, may be useful. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major health burden in the developing world and in immunocompromised hosts, but few new effective anti-tuberculosis agents have been developed. Recent studies suggest that traditional high-throughput Mtb drug development assays that non-specifically target proliferation may not be useful in improving patient outcome because this model does not recapitulate in vivo conditions (Nathan et al. 2008). Rather, Mtb displays a cellular heterogeneity with a small fraction of the total population that is resistant to conventional therapies and is relatively quiescent. Non-replicating bacteria may be critical to the problem of persistent Mtb infection. The striking parallels to cancer biology cannot be ignored and are not surprising as nature tends to repeat patterns. While not all cancers may display a clear cellular hierarchy of tumor growth, the heterogeneity of cancers is essential to incorporate in models. Cancer stem cells, which have been also described as tumor initiating cells or tumor propagating cells, are tumor cells that make copies of themselves (self renew) and propagate tumors similar to the parental tumor. Cancer stem cells from glioblastomas share some characteristics with normal brain stem cells including the expression of neural stem cell markers, the capacity for self renewal and long term proliferation, and the ability to differentiate into multiple nervous system lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes). However, brain tumor stem cells exhibit significant distinctions from normal stem cells in frequency, proliferation, aberrant expression of differentiation markers, chromosomal abnormalities, and tumor formation. The potent tumorigenic capacity of cancer stem cells coupled with increasing evidence of radioresistance and chemoresistance suggests that cancer stem cells contribute to tumor maintenance and recurrence. Thus, targeting cancer stem cells may offer new avenues of therapeutic intervention. This hypothesis has been recently validated in clinical trial of breast cancer in which patients undergoing treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy experienced an increase in breast cancer stem cells in the surviving tumor while the use of a therapy targeting the stem cell population stabilized the cancer stem cell population. Cancer cells grow in harsh environments with low levels of oxygen and nutrients and high levels of acid and metabolic byproducts. Rather than causing detrimental effects to cancer cells, the toxic tumor environment is associated with resistance to therapy and increased invasion into normal tissue. Cells that can survive in tumor regions with low oxygen and nutrients activate survival mechanisms with direct consequences for patients afflicted with cancer. These findings have led to the development of new therapies or techniques that may reverse the survival effects of the tumor regions of low oxygen/nutrition with limited success to date in clinical trials. We hypothesized that cancer stem cells may respond to low oxygen levels in a manner different from the rest of the tumor cells. In work currently in publication, we have discovered that brain tumor stem cells have specific molecular responses to low oxygen and inhibiting these responses blocks the ability of cancer stem cells to survive and grow. We are currently extending these studies to examine other potential therapeutic targets that may be downstream from the effects of low oxygen responses. Another extension of these studies has been to understand how low oxygen may contribute to the resistance of cancer stem cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Many models of cancer stem cells imply a one-way transition from a stem-like cancer cell towards a more differentiated cell that is less likely to be able to grow long term and resist radiation and chemotherapy. Some investigators have suggested that treatments that kill cancer stem cells are the essential weapon required to improve cancer treatment. Indeed, a recent study from Germany has suggested that the chemotherapy most commonly used to treat glioblastoma patients, temozolomide (Temodar), kills cancer stem cells. We and others have demonstrated that another therapy in clinical trial for glioblastomas, the anti-angiogenic antibody bevacizumab (Avastin), can also kill cancer stem cells by disrupting a location (niche) that supports the growth of cancer stem cells. These studies are exciting because they suggest that known effective treatments may achieve results due, in part, to effects on cancer stem cells. However, there is a significant caveat: non-stem cancer cells (i.e. the bulk of the tumor) may be able to move back toward a more stem-like state. The field of stem cell biology has been remarkably energized by the 2006 discovery that normal adult cells could be “reprogrammed” to become undifferentiated multi-potent stem cells capable of becoming any cell in the human body. The recipe for reprogramming cells included only four genes, three of which have been linked to brain tumor stem cells. More recent studies have shown that brain (neural) stem cells can be reprogrammed to the multi-potent state with only a single gene. The advances in nuclear reprogramming have caused excitement as we envision the creation of patient-specific resources for tissue regeneration and repair. In our excitement, we cannot fail to acknowledge the potential for disease that could arise from the acquisition of stem-like characteristics with the ability to overcome the body’s natural defenses. Normal stem cells must be able to move to locations of injury and survive in dangerous environments, so it is of little surprise that cancer stem cells acquire these traits. While we must guess the constituent requirements needed for reprogramming, cancer cells face evolutionary pressures that select for altering the expression or structure of genes that give advantage. Cancer biologists have typically considered proliferation the goal of cancer cells but acquisition of other characteristics           ", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Cleveland Clinic', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020201\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

However, they are one of the most lethal forms and are the most common cause of cancer death in the 30-40 year old age group. This has a significant impact on society. The most common type of brain tumor is glioblastoma Multiforme ( ), which is also the most lethal and difficult form to treat. With optimal therapy the median survival is approximately 40-60 weeks from diagnosis. Current chemotherapeutic agents to treat GBM include temozolomide, (Nitrosureas), cisplatin, bevacizumab, irinotecan, and a small proportion of GBM responds to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib or erlotinib. Current targeted therapies in malignant gliomas have been associated with various response rates and modest to no survival benefits. Therefore, (1) new targets and (2) the development of improved strategies are required to improve the effectiveness of targeted agents for this devastating cancer. Our research proposal aims to address both of these issues. Our findings strongly indicate that dynamin II ( ), an endocytic protein, is a new target to develop inhibitors for pharmacological intervention for the treatment of glioblastoma. We have discovered that dynII plays a crucial role in the final stage of mitosis, cytokinesis. Cytokinesis involves ingression of the plasma membrane between segregating chromosomes followed by membrane abscission, resulting in the production of two independent daughter cells. Our studies reveal that dynII, controls the abscission step during mammalian cell cytokinesis. Several inhibitors of mitotic proteins have emerged in preclinical or early clinical development for the treatment of cancers. The target proteins to date have been cyclin-dependent kinase, checkpoint kinase, aurora kinase and polo-like kinase, and mitotic kinesin. Inhibitors of these proteins have been evaluated in various hematologic and solid malignancies. A recent manuscript reported that depletion of the mitotic protein, Aurora-B, enhances the anti-tumor effect of temozolomide in human glioma cells. This indicates that inhibitors of mitotic proteins have the potential to be useful chemotherapeutic agents for glioblastoma. The 10 year collaboration between the Robinson and McCluskey teams has resulted in development of ∼20 structurally distinct classes of dynamin inhibitors, each targeting one of the four dynamin domains. Several lines of evidence strongly support our hypothesis that dynamin inhibition is a novel approach for the treatment of cancer, specifically glioblastoma: One of the major difficulties in treating brain tumors with chemotherapeutic agents is that most of these molecules are unable to penetrate the blood brain barrier ( ) effectively. This renders these molecules essentially useless for the treatment of glioblastoma. The inability of chemotherapeutic agents to cross the BBB can be due to their polarity, hydrophobicity and active drug efflux transporters at the blood-brain, blood-cerebrospinal and blood-tumor barriers. Several of the dynamin inhibitors we have generated have recently been tested in epilepsy mouse models at the Anti-convulsant Screening Program (NIH, Bethesda). The findings reveal a reduction in seizures following treatment with dynamin inhibitors from several different classes. Thus, we already have molecules that are capable of crossing the BBB and have a CNS action. In addition, we have identified a pharmacological mechanism of selectively targeting drugs to brain cells. This technology involves the development of two types of pro-drugs, and a combination of both. The first is a “brain-lock” chemical modification of our drugs so that they can pass through the BBB. Drug delivery through the BBB is by molecular packaging and sequential metabolism. Once it is in the brain it becomes activated by brain-cell-specific oxygenase cleavage, which transforms into a membrane impermeable molecule. Thus, molecules that have crossed the BBB are retained, and the residual excreted, ensuring that the drugs cytotoxic effects are restricted to the brain. The second is “pro-drugs” whereby cell wall permeating side chains are added to the dynamin inhibitors. This renders them temporarily inactive as inhibitors and far more membrane permeable. Once they enter cells, esterases cleave the pro-drug back to the active compound, effectively trapping it inside cells. Both pro-drug and brain-lock chemistries are well known and established by our group. However, this project will be the first time they have ever been combined into a single molecule, first targeting the brain, then the glioblastoma cells therein. Therefore, . The specific aims are: This proposal draws on the strengths and multi-disciplinary collaboration of six large and wellestablished research groups. All of our members have collaborated heavily with each other, but this proposal is the first to bring them all together as a single team. Our overall aim is to combine the expertise and knowledge of each individual group to identify the most efficacious dynamin inhibitor that will ultimately be investigated in human clinical trials for the treatment of glioblastoma. Our core areas of expertise are medicinal chemistry development of dynamin inhibitors, dynamin biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, characterisation of the role of dynamin in cell division and analysis of glioblastoma mouse models. The results will reveal those dynamin inhibitors that cause cell death specifically following cytokinesis failure and thus inhibit cell growth. These characteristics are extremely important as they predict that these small-molecule inhibitors will not affect non-proliferating non-tumor cells. Thus, their efficacy is expected to be dramatically improved compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Our results will also identify those dynamin inhibitors that reduce glioblastoma tumor growth in a mouse cancer model. Overall, we aim to identify new anti-cancer agents that are more effective than currently used chemotherapeutic agents. A successful outcome will provide patients with an increased survival period and improved quality of life.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': \"Children's Medical Research Institute\", 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020204\\n', 'year': '2009', 'amount': '164,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

If you came back 200,000 years later, the brown birds would have gone, and instead you would find two types of birds, a small one with reddish tail feathers and a large one with bluish tail feathers. If you were able to do a phylogenetic analysis, you would find that these two new groups are very closely related, and that the brown birds were their common ancestor. Naturally, you would wonder what happened to the brown birds during the 200,000 years that have gone by. The short answer is: speciation has occurred. This, however, is only a name for a very complicated process that has occupied the minds of theoretical and empirical biologists ever since Darwin. While Darwin's main focus were the processes by which already existing species adapt to different niches (such as resources that are easiest to consume by small or large bids), he was well aware of the difficulties that arise in explaining the origin and persistence of species, e.g. with regard to the establishment of mating barriers and reproductive isolation (as when birds only mate with other birds having similarly colored tail feathers). In fact, for Darwin speciation was 'the mystery of mysteries'. Not only is it difficult to explain single events of evolutionary diversification like the split of an ancestral species into two distinct descendant species, but the amount of diversity that has evolved over time is enormous. When a scientist collected beetles from a single tropical tree species, he found 682 different beetle species, 140 of which he estimated to be specialized to live exclusively on that single species of tree. Since there are ca. 50,000 different species of tropical trees, he concluded that there are ca. 7 million of specialist beetle species alone! In fact, the total number of species of animals and plants on earth has been estimated to lie between 10 and 100 million. Adding to that the fact that the number of extant species is estimated to constitute ca. 1% of the number of species that ever existed on the planet, one arrives at a truly amazing picture of the evolution of biological diversity. There is a rather surprising logical connection between the enormous amount of extant diversity and a single event of evolutionary diversification: presumably, all extant species arose form a single common ancestor. Understanding the mechanisms and processes that lead to speciation is therefore of fundamental importance in biology. For speciation to occur, two processes are required. Subpopulations of an ancestral species must diverge genetically, and these diverging subpopulations must become reproductively isolated. It is difficult to imagine how subpopulations can genetically diverge from each other if they occupy the same geographical range, because these subpopulations would continue to exchange genetic material. It is perhaps deceptively easy to envisage that populations evolving in separate locations would eventually become reproductively isolated due to genetic incompatibilities. Even though the potential genetic mechanisms leading to reproductive isolation between geographically separated populations are actually only poorly understood, these considerations have led to the dominant belief among evolutionary biologists that speciation occurs most often in allopatry, i.e. due to geographical isolation between subpopulations of a single ancestral species. Prominent evolutionists have forcefully supported this view and have in essence proclaimed that speciation under sympatric conditions, that is, in the absence of geographical isolation, does simply not happen. However, views about speciation have started to change in recent years, both for empirical and theoretical reasons. On the one hand, molecular phylogenetic data have revealed many examples of closely related species that have a common ancestor and that almost certainly evolved in sympatry. For example, species flocks of cichlid fishes in small crater lakes in Cameroon evolved under sympatric conditions, yet often have a common ancestor. In addition, there have been a number of experimental studies showing how ecological interactions, such as competition for food, can create conditions for divergence between sympatrically occurring types. Finally, the famous example of adaptation to different host plants in apple maggot flies shows how reproductive isolation can evolve in sympatry if mating behavior is contingent on diverging ecological traits. These findings have received strong theoretical support from a new theory of adaptive dynamics. This theoretical framework for studying evolution as a dynamical system in phenotype space was developed by Hans Metz and his colleagues at the University of Leiden. The phenomenon of evolutionary branching is one of the paradigmatic features of adaptive dynamics. During evolutionary branching, an evolving population first gradually evolves to a point in phenotype space at which selection becomes disruptive due to ecological interactions within the evolving population. Disruptive selection implies selection against intermediate types, and consequently the population splits into two diverging phenotypic clusters. Evolutionary branching has been shown to occur in models involving all basic types of ecological interactions: competition, predation, and mutualism. In addition, models for evolutionary branching have been extended to include mulitlocus genetics and the evolution of assortative mating and reproductive isolation, which has led to a the development of a general theoretical framework for studying ecological mechanisms of speciation under fully sympatric conditions. Together with the empirical results documenting sympatric origins of many species, the theoretical plausibility of evolutionary branching presents a strong challenge to the classical theory of allopatric speciation. The general aim of the work I propose to do is to reconcile ecological mechanisms and geographical patterns of speciation by studying processes of evolutionary diversification in spatially structured populations. I first propose to develop stochastic individual-based models for coevolving populations occupying spatially continuous regions in order to assess the role of spatial structure for adaptive divergence. Together with Ulf Dieckmann from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis I have started to construct individual-based models for a single, spatially structured population in which individuals compete for resources. These models have already revealed surprising results: due to local adaptation along an environmental gradient and to spatially localized competitive interactions, individuals are more likely to interact with other individuals of similar phenotypes. The models show that this effect increases the propensity for evolutionary branching. Moreover, when evolutionary branching occurs the two emerging species are spatially segregated. Thus, spatial structure not only facilitates diversification, but intrinsically symmetric processes of speciation (local frequency-dependent competition) can generate allopatric species distributions. This provides an entirely new perspective on the role of geographical structure for speciation processes. The proposed theoretical work consists of a full-scale investigation of evolutionary branching in spatially structured populations whose coevolution is driven by all basic types of ecological interactions. The main focus will be on investigating the general phenomena of facilitation of diversification and spatial pattern formation as a consequence of spatially localized interactions. The resulting models are complex stochastic systems of interacting individuals that are computationally very demanding. With the help of analytical approximations, these models will elucidate the importance of geographical structure for processes of speciation. Our theory will thus establish a long due synthesis of allopatric and sympatric speciation scenarios. While empirical findings have shown that speciation under sympatric conditions is plausible, direct experimental tests of the ecological mechanisms of speciation are still largely lacking: the long evolutionary time scales involved make it difficult to observe the whole process of diversification form beginning to end. However, experimental evolution in microbial model systems offers a way out of the conundrum of long generation times. Indeed, rapid diversification has been observed in microbial microcosms. In collaboration with Michael Travisano from the University of Houston I have started to test the ecological mechanisms driving such diversification by using the bacterium Escherichia coli as experimental model system. We have obtained promising preliminary results showing that under sympatric conditions, multiple resources promote evolutionary diversification of a single ancestral strain into multiple strains specializing on different resources. This conforms to expectations from adaptive dynamics models of evolutionary branching, and I will extend these experimental studies to spatially structured bacterial populations. This will be achieved by varying environmental resource conditions gradually over a series of chemostat cultures. Local dispersal is imposed by exchanging fractions of bacterial populations between adjacent chemostats corresponding to similar environmental conditions. By varying system parameters such as the migration rate and the slope of the environmental gradient, it is then possible to assess the effect of spatial structure on the likelihood and the amount of diversification. It will be very interesting to test the conditions leading to spatial pattern formation of the diverging strains across the environmental gradient. In addition, determining the genetic changes underlying diversification will give important insights into the genetics underlying diversification. In sum, I propose to study the adaptive mechanisms leading to evolutionary diversification in geographically structured populations. A combined theoretical and experimental approach will provide essential insights into the complex process that ultimately generates biodiversity: speciation, the mystery of mysteries.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of British Columbia', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002059\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '427,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Their dynamics are often so complex that they cannot\r\nbe understood without the aid of theoretical models that link underlying ecological mechanisms\r\nto the dynamical patterns those mechanisms are expected to produce . Traditionally, ecological theory has built upon the principles of deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems , producing\r\nmodels that capture one of the prime causes of complicated ecological dynamics: nonlinear\r\ninteractions within and among species. Stochasticity is also well known to influence ecological\r\ndynamics . When we nevertheless invoke deterministic theory, we implicitly assume that\r\nstochasticity will primarily act to blur the deterministic signal such that the theory will still be\r\napproximately true in more realistic stochastic settings. By this design, we miss any qualitative\r\neffects of stochasticity so, although ecological theory grounded in determinism is often quite\r\nuseful , where it does fail us, the failure is big. A major goal of my research program is to\r\nunderstand qualitative effects of stochasticity in ecological systems , where stochastic models\r\ncan sometimes behave quite differently from their deterministic analogues . My current research is on qualitative effects of stochasticity within an ecological context of great concern: the potential for ecosystems to shift suddenly and unexpectedly from their historical state to a new and very different state, with no imminent shift\r\nback . Ecologists have largely sought to understand this phenomenon through the analysis\r\nand application of deterministic models that have “alternative stable states”: multiple stable\r\nequilibria under a single set of conditions . While this theoretical framework has lead to great\r\nadvances in our understanding of some sudden regime shifts in ecology , its sole emphasis on\r\ndeterministic stability makes it fairly narrow in scope. In stochastic systems, stable equilibria\r\ndon’t tell the whole story. For instance, some unstable solutions can trap stochastic dynamics for\r\nlong periods of time , essentially masquerading as additional stable states within the stochastic\r\nsystem. Some systems with one stable state (and one or several unstable ones) may therefore\r\nbehave indistinguishably, in the presence of stochasticity, from those with multiple stable states. The idea that stochasticity can blur the distinction between stable and unstable dynamics\r\nhas the potential to transform our thinking on alternative states. Because only a relatively narrow\r\nsubset of ecological models displays deterministic multi-stability, ecosystems with alternative\r\nstable states have garnered special concern. However, virtually all models have multiple (stable\r\nplus unstable) equilibria. My research asks when these systems can have an equivalent potential\r\nfor sudden state shifts, and whether our focus on deterministically multi-stable systems in the\r\nstudy of regime shifts is dangerously narrow.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Case Western Reserve University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020364\\n', 'year': '2013', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These include the\r\ndistributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central\r\ncontrol), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and\r\nthe ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple, and sometimes very different,\r\napplication and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. These observations, some dating back to the 60’s, have inspired the development of several computational\r\nmethods including neural networks and genetic algorithms. However, this early work relied on a highlevel\r\n(and often flawed) understanding of biological processes. While these methods led to several\r\nsuccessful applications, they usually did not lead to new insights regarding the ways in which information\r\nis processed in biological networks. Similarly, little thought has been given to how such information\r\nprocessing in biology can serve as a basis for robust and adaptable methods for computer networks.

The Molecular Biology revolution and the\r\ntriumphant sequencing of the human genome leave us with one paradox: the deep\r\nconservation of the molecular processes that constitute biology. As we look into more\r\nand more organisms, we find similar molecules, similar pathways, similar chemistry.\r\nBiology has evolved immense diversity with the same few parts. The research program in my lab aims to build a quantitative framework for\r\nunderstanding how the same few parts can generate diverse organisms. We integrate\r\nmathematical and experimental approaches to analyze the architecture of the conserved\r\nmolecular pathways, their deployment into diverse contexts, and the way the molecular\r\nprocesses are connected to one another and embedded into the larger network. Where we have looked, we see evidence that these deeply conserved processes may\r\nhave evolved special properties that facilitate diverse uses and adaptation to new uses.\r\nWe see evidence of design features that allow these conserved molecular pathways to\r\nfunction robustly in the presence of cellular noise. We see evidence of design features\r\nthat allow these molecular pathways to be easily plugged into diverse contexts. We see\r\nevidence that these molecular processes may be connected in a way that facilitates rapid\r\nadaptation to environmental change. Moreover, we see evidence of design features that\r\nexplain how these molecular pathways may be so conserved when natural selection acts\r\non a distant level. As in music, the Internet, or electrical system, having conserved parts\r\n(e.g., chords, TCP/ IP, plugs and sockets) may facilitate evolvability in biology. The complexity of biological systems has bewildered many imaginative minds in history.\r\nThe doctrine of Vitalism reigned up to the nineteenth century, and prescribed the\r\npresence of vital force in biological organisms – an idea that still resonates today in the\r\nway we use the word \"soul\". Even Alfred Russel Wallace – who independently\r\nconceived the theory of evolution, insisted that, as a consequence of his\r\nhyperadaptionatist view, human intelligence could not be accounted for by the theory of\r\nevolution. The current optimism that all aspects of biological complexity is not beyond\r\nthe sphere of science comes from biological revolutions in the twentieth century, and the\r\nrapid progress that followed. From the re-discovery of Mendel's work by de Vries in\r\n1900, to the elucidation of DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, to the complete\r\nsequencing of the human genome in 2004: within one hundred years, biology has turned\r\nfrom a descriptive science into a predictive experimental science. The great waves of revolution leave us with one paradox–one that I believe to be\r\nthe grand challenge for the present students of biological complexity. The abundant\r\nanatomical and behavioral diversity we see in animals around us is underlain by deep\r\nmolecular conservation (Figure 1). Biological systems are built using the same few parts.\r\nThere are two parts of the argument here: conservation and economy. Molecular\r\nprocesses are deeply conserved: all cells rely on DNA as the genetic material; cellular\r\ncomponents are conserved (e.g., nucleus, organelles); body plan and the controlling\r\ngenes are conserved; and, most strikingly, all animal cells utilize conserved molecular\r\npathways. Not only biology builds diversity with the same parts, it does so with\r\nstaggering economy. The fact that we are only 20% different (by comparing proteins)\r\nfrom the single-cell amoeba illustrates the mystery. The human genome encodes about\r\n20,000 genes, about 1.5 times more than the tiny fruit flies. From starfish on the\r\noceanbed to bumblebees in our backyard to humans on the streets of New York, we are\r\nbuilt using the same few parts. If the parts are the same, how do we build humans? How\r\ndo we build bumblebees? How do we build starfish? . Diverse organisms, conserved parts. The immense diversity in anatomy, function, and\r\nbehavior arises from repeated use of few, conserved molecular parts. The paradox between conserved parts and diverse outcomes may be explained by\r\ncombinatorial uses of the parts (Figure 2A). For example, in the fruit fly segmentation, different combinations of transcription factors give rise to different cell\r\nfates.9 In some mutants, this results in flies carrying a perfect, second pair of wings\r\n(Figure 2A). The paradox between conserved parts and diverse outcomes may also be\r\nexplained by higher specialization of the parts (Figure 2B). For example, inputs to\r\nsignaling pathways vary from species to species. In the Wnt signaling pathway that is\r\nfound in all animal cells: the pathway has 7 inputs in fruit flies, 12 inputs in sea\r\nanomeone, and 19 inputs in mice and humans. Finally, the paradox between\r\nconserved parts and diverse outcomes may also be explained by using each part in a\r\nquantitatively different manner (Figure 2C). For example, the beak morphology of\r\nGalapagos finches has been correlated with the expression domain of the conserved\r\nsignaling protein Bmp. In each argument, what is common is the ease by which biology can implement a\r\nrelatively simple change and produce a complex, and useful, new function. Combinatorial\r\nuse implies the ease by which conserved processes can be plugged into different contexts.\r\nInput diversification implies the ease by which conserved processes can evolve response\r\nto new stimuli. The Darwin’s finches example implies the ease by which a simple\r\nchange in protein expression can trigger a coordinated response from the general head\r\nmorphogenesis, skeletal system, circulatory system, and nervous system – each itself\r\nconstituted of conserved molecular processes – to produce a functional beak. In each\r\nexample, a network of conserved processes responds to a simple change and produces\r\nuseful phenotypes. Each example suggests that the conserved parts themselves have\r\nspecial properties that facilitate diverse and new uses. This is the centerpiece of the research program in my lab: What kind of properties\r\ndo the conserved parts have that facilitate versatile uses? The idea that the conserved\r\nparts themselves may facilitate verstile uses, and consequently evolvability, was first\r\nproposed by Kirschner and Gerhart in their Theory of Facilitated Variation.15 We want to\r\nexpand and build the quantitative foundation for this argument. In my lab, we integrate\r\nmathematical and experimental approaches to explore the architecture of conserved\r\nprocesses in biology. Our approach is indeed bottom-up: we look for properties that\r\nallow these conserved parts to be used in a robust manner (Direction 1), plugged into\r\ndiverse contexts (Direction 2), and facilitate evolvability (Direction 3). As I will\r\nillustrate here, analyzing the complexity at the level of molecular pathways gives us\r\nleverage to address complexity at the level of tissues and subsequently at the level of\r\nembryos. Conserved parts can be used in different combination to generate different outcomes. For example, altering combination of transcription factors can produce mutant flies\r\nwith a second pair of wings.  Conserved parts may evolve new inputs and outputs. For example, the genome of the fruit fly contains 7 genes. That means the fly genome encodes 7 proteins that have very similar sequences and act as ligands in the Wnt pathway. The sea anemones have 12 genes. Mouse and humans have 19 genes.  Conserved parts may be quantitatively tuned to produce different outcomes. For\r\nexample, in the finches, the embryo of the large-beaked shows a broad\r\nexpression of the signaling molecule Bmp. By constrast, the embryo of the narrow-beaked shows a narrow domain of Bmp.

And we don't see monkeys in the wild working away at math problems! Even if they could, how would we know? We can't ask babies or animals about their thoughts. Can any concrete thought take place without language? Astonishingly, recent research tells us that yes, babies and animals can think abstractly and they can even think about concepts as seemingly complex as number. Studying numerical cognition provides a test bed for the challenge of understanding cognition without language. As adults we measure, order, label, and categorize almost every aspect of the world with numbers. Without numbers much of modern civilization would be impossible. The ability to use number is one of the most complex cognitive abilities that humans possess and is often held up as a defining feature of the human mind. A crucial reason for interest in nonverbal number representations is that number is an abstract property of a set of stimuli. While two pork BBQ sandwiches and two petunias do not look, feel, taste, or smell alike they are equally good examples of two-ness. As adult humans we recognize the numerical equivalence between sets as diverse as four ballet dancers and four pirouettes, three musicians and three saxophone notes, or two presidential candidates and two political philosophies. Such examples illustrate that we form numerical representations when viewing simultaneously occurring visual sets (e.g., ballet dancers), successively occurring visual events (e.g., four pirouettes), successively occurring auditory events (e.g., three musical notes), or when thinking about sets as abstract as ideas. These examples also illustrate that number representations are abstract in that they require us to equate sets that differ in many physical dimensions (e.g., size, shape, color) and instead classify based on an emergent property of the set [1]. Can a baby or a monkey hold such an abstract concept? Are there developmental and evolutionary building blocks that serve as a foundation for adult mathematical cognition? Without a doubt no monkey nor human baby can come close to achieving the mathematical ability of a college student. However, while educated adults possess a complex symbol system for representing and manipulating numbers, we share with nonhuman animals and preverbal human infants a more primitive system for representing number as mental magnitudes that can be manipulated in arithmetic operations. As we delve into the neural bases of these nonverbal numerical abilities we are finding that homologous regions of parietal cortex are being used in adult humans, young children, and rhesus monkeys. This essay reviews the ground-breaking behavioral and neurobiological work that has led to our current understanding of the building blocks of adult mathematical cognition and identifies some of the many challenges that remain.

Titles of published manuscripts clearly illustrate this tendency in focus. Examples include: 'Evolution of the hemagglutinin of equine H3 influenza virus' and 'Mechanisms of GII.4 Norovirus Persistence in Human Populations'. Determining how a specific virus x evolves in a specific host population y is of course an important avenue of research. However, we are now at a point in time when we can synthesize across these research findings to identify general patterns of viral evolution and what processes shape them. An effective approach towards the identification of these general patterns and processes requires more than listing specific examples and qualitatively categorizing them. It requires a quantitatively rigorous framework. Here, we propose the development of this framework, which shares fundamental similarities with an approach that has been extremely effective in the physical field of fluid mechanics. The field of fluid mechanics focuses on understanding the dynamics of fluid flows. Flows are categorized into two general types: laminar (smooth) flow and turbulent flow. When does a fluid flowing through or over an object exhibit laminar flow and when does it exhibit turbulent flow? To predict this, physicists use a quantity called the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, computed as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Inertial forces depend both of the velocity of the fluid and the characteristic length of the object, while viscous forces depend only on the properties of the fluid. As a ratio between these two quantities, the Reynolds number therefore depends both on the fluid and the object through which it flows. To compute the Reynolds number for a specific system, physicists simply measure these necessary parameters for any specific fluid and any specific object. The value of the Reynolds number allows for an immediate prediction of the type of flow dynamic that will result: low Reynolds numbers produce laminar flows, while high Reynolds numbers produce turbulent flows. The Reynolds number is a powerful tool in fluid mechanics, resulting in three distinct advantages. First, the Reynolds number allows for a greater understanding of which parameters are important for impacting flow conditions. Second, the Reynolds number enables reliable, quantitative predictions of flow dynamics, even for cases of fluid flow that have not been experimentally determined. Third, the Reynolds number facilitates the development of general engineering strategies for controlling flow. These three advantages of the Reynolds number in the field of fluid mechanics are common to dimensionless quantities more generally: they allow for greater understanding, prediction, and control. Dimensionless quantities have these advantages because their structure allows for a mathematically elegant way to move from the specifics of systems to comparative analyses across systems. In essence, they are similar to a common language which allows for communication across different cultures. They have been extensively used in physics, and their use in biology has started to rise. This increase has occurred as biologists have become more quantitative and as the benefit of these dimensionless numbers in other fields has become increasingly evident. Here, we propose the use of a dimensionless number to understand patterns of viral evolution and the processes driving them. We propose this approach because we see two striking parallels between fluid flow and viral evolution. First, as mentioned, fluid flows can be categorized into two distinct dynamical regimes: laminar flow and turbulent flow. Similarly, viral evolution in host populations can be categorized into two distinct dynamical regimes, based on their phylogenies: cactus-like evolution and acacia-like evolution. Viruses exhibiting cactus-like evolution have limited genetic diversity over time. Imagine a cactus and its branches: the number of branches at any level of the cactus is approximately the same. Similarly, the amount of genetic diversity at any point in time is approximately the same for viruses exhibiting cactus-like evolution. Examples include influenza A virus in human hosts, HIV evolution within a single infected human, and norovirus evolution in humans. In contrast, viruses exhibiting acacia-like evolution exhibit continued growth in their genetic diversity over time. Again, imagine an acacia tree and its branches: the number of branches increases towards the top of the tree. Similarly, the amount of genetic diversity increases with time for viruses exhibiting acacia-like phylogenies. Examples include measles in humans and influenza A virus evolution in pigs. Second, whether a fluid flow is laminar or turbulent depends both on the fluid and on the object through which it passes. Similarly, whether a virus exhibits cactus-like evolution or acacia-like evolution depends not only on the virus itself, but also the host population in which it is evolving. In lieu of viscous and inertial forces, viral evolution depends on parameters such as the virus's mutation rate, the degree of cross-immunity between different strains, host lifespan, and the virus's reproductive rate in the host population. The project proposed here consists of two parts. Part I focuses on the mathematical derivation of an appropriate dimensionless number for viral evolution. Part II focuses on three applications of this derived dimensionless quantity. The first application is the testing of this dimensional quantity with observed virological data. Does computing this dimensionless parameter for several host-virus systems enable us to correctly predict their evolutionary patterns? The second application is the comparison between viral evolution at different scales. Can a virus chronically infecting a single host, like HIV, evolve similarly to a virus that is evolving at the level of the whole population, like influenza? The third application is to determine whether the value of the dimensionless quantity is changing over time for specific host-virus systems. If so, do we see a transition from one type of evolution (e.g., a cactus-like one) to a different type (e.g., an acacia-like one)? In sum, a dimensionless quantity for viral evolution, akin to the Reynolds number in fluid mechanics, would result in improved understanding, prediction, and control. We would have a better understanding of why certain viruses in certain host populations evolve similarly to or differently from other viruses in other host populations. We would have better predictive capabilities of viral evolution when a new pandemic strain entered our population. And, finally, we would employ better viral control strategies by sharing strategies across different systems and by understanding the leverage points of viral evolution.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Duke University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020167\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '448,937', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

These represent intellectual activities that have important consequences for the economic and technological well being of our society. However, the complexity of these activities poses a major barrier to their scientific understanding. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has the potential to be an unparalleled source of information about complex cognition. The temporal resolution of fMRI, often a source of frustration in understanding the detail of simple acts of cognition, is well matched to the temporal grain size of complex cognition. The spatial resolution of fMRI is sufficient to allow identification of regions that have functional significance in the interpretation of complex cognition. The goal of the project is to simultaneously address the two main barriers to realizing the potential of fMRI to inform theories of complex cognition. The first barrier is the lack of a rigorous theoretical framework with which to interpret the significance of the complex activation patterns that fMRI reveals. Cognitive architectures (e.g., Anderson et al., 2004; Just & Varma, 2007; Laird, 2008; Meyer & Kieras, 1997) can provide that interpretative structure. To date these cognitive architectures have largely been used to explain behavioral data. Models have been developed in these architectures that can provide detailed accounts of complex cognitive competences as varied as solving mathematical problems, playing backgammon, and flying fighter jets. In our lab we have been developing bridging assumptions that allow one to map the component activities in these architectures to the activity patterns in different brain regions. This can lead to better understanding of the functional significance of these activity patterns and bring needed empirical constraint to theorizing within these architectures. The second barrier is more methodological. Complex activities like mathematical problem solving display substantial variability in the timing and choice of steps. Because interpreting fMRI data requires inference from multiple aligned observations, such temporal and strategic variability typically destroys the interpretability of this data source. This project will use rich behavioral measures such as response times, eye movements, and verbal protocols to provide the signposts for aligning fMRI data from different trials. Such behavioral data can reveal the content of specific problem-solving episodes and the accompanying imaging data can reveal the engagement of the underlying cognitive processes. This project will integrate the theoretical structure of cognitive architectures with aligning procedures for fMRI to develop a new theoretical methodology for understanding complex cognition.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020162\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

To find food, you need to determine which objects might be food, observe other animals' eating habits to determine what is possibly safe, and then make decisions--possibly involving hard tradeoffs--about what exactly to eat. And of course, this whole process is dynamic: you learn from the outcomes of your choices, revise your understanding of what is edible, and so on. Everyday cognition similarly requires an astonishing range of cognition, even in familiar environments: we categorize objects, make inferences about them, learn causal relations between them, make plans and take actions given causal beliefs, observe and categorize the outcomes of our actions, learn from those outcomes, and so on. Despite this variety, our cognition is quite seamless: we move between cognitive processes and representations with ease, and different types of cognition seem to share information easily. This integration is unsurprising, since an isolated cognitive process or representation will almost always be either highly specialized, or useless. This picture of integrated cognition stands in stark contrast with much of the practice of the cognitive sciences. While allusions are often made to the relevance of other cognitive operations, research almost always focuses on a single process or representation, particularly in the cognitive domains of: (i) causal learning/reasoning; (ii) concept acquisition/application; and (iii) decision-making/action selection. Experiments on causal learning rarely require decision or action in the world; concept learning experiments focus on judgments about likelihoods that novel objects fall in various categories; decision-making experiments explicitly provide relevant probabilities; and so on. The present project aims to bring these three areas of cognitive science together by: (a) developing integrated models of this particular trio of cognitive domains; and (b) determining how those models are, or could be, implemented in neural systems or circuits. The first component of this project aims to develop and empirically test an integrated model of causal, conceptual, and decision-making cognition. This model will provide a single explanatory framework, and thereby help unify our theoretical and empirical understanding of these three cognitive domains. This integrated model will be developed using the framework of graphical models: a rich computational framework that provides the representational and algorithmic resources to capture much of our complex cognition, and has already proven successful for several cognitive domains. The second component of the project will explore lower-level representations and processes that could plausibly implement the high-level, integrated model of these three different cognitive domains. Rather than trying to jump from high-level cognition to neural systems in one move, two different strategies will be pursued in parallel: (i) developing implementations using lower-level cognitive models for which there are plausible neural implementations; and (ii) investigating structured neural networks that can capture learning and inference in dynamically changing graphical models. The former will provide an intermediate stage in a multi-step implementation; the latter will provide theoretical guidance about how neural implementations are possible for the high-level integration of the three cognitive domains.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020161\\n', 'year': '2008', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Yet in many cases, these phenomena persist despite both large scale population turnover and concerted efforts to propagate alternatives. For example, social cohesion depends on being able to keep alive a set of common shared beliefs and practices within a collective that turns over continuously and/or faces challenges to their belief system. The mechanics of this process pose a deep mystery for network science: in the face of sometimes massive network turnover, how do some beliefs remain stable?  Or, put another way, what are the limits to demographic turnover or competing ideologies in social systems? . My strategy to solve this problem builds on insights from structural cohesion (Moody & White 2003) and the limiting effects of relational timing on diffusion (Moody 2002, Kontoleon et al 2013). The crucial challenge is to identify the ways in which these features create feedback cycles in the network that can sustain transmission over time. The interaction structure needs to literally re-circulate the diffusion bit of interest over time, and the aggregation of temporal network cycles provides the foundation for this recirculation. This approach extends tools developed for the temporal projections of dynamic networks (Moody 2009, Mucha et al 2010), contact process models (Sander, Ferreira, and Pastor-Satorras  2013), generalizations of complex transmission process (Centola and Macy 2007) and formal epidemiological approaches (Pastro-Satorras and Vespignani 2001). The simplest approximations to these processes have been encapsulated in extensions of epidemic models on homogeneous networks (Zhao et al 2012; Cator, Bovenkamp and Van Mieghem 2013) or continuous time contact process models. But these approximations do not handle dynamic networks with high population turnover, complex network structures, or transmission processes that require multiple reinforcements to propagate. The best alternative is to use agent based modeling (ABM) approaches that allow us to build realistic complexity into our models. For this fellowship, I propose developing an ABM approach that leverages earlier insights about cycles and diffusion in dynamic networks to situations where diffusion requires reinforcement. The key graph theoretic questions turn on how cycles in the contact network and interaction timing overlap with the necessary refresh rate of whatever is diffusing through the network to keep the belief endemic. The result will be the ability to characterize networks by their differential capacity to sustain belief across a wide array of transmission regimes: to identify the network’s . I see this as a lynchpin problem, admitting to many substantive extensions: once these mechanisms are identified, can the same fundamental network tools be used to understand wide swings in beliefs (“fads” or “bubbles”) or the persistence of a belief in the face of a competing diffusion processes (such as when holding one belief precludes holding another). Ultimately this will allow one to compare networks across multiple domains on a key link between system structure and performance. Cator, E., R van de Bovenkamp and  P.

For most of modern scientific history, one fundamental barrier to understanding these systems was our limited ability to record high-fidelity measurements of the phenomenon of interest.  Fortunately, engineering advances in sensor technology over the last few decades have allowed observation of complex systems at an unprecedented scale, giving us novel views of many important phenomena. While modern science is ingrained with the premise that higher fidelity observations of these dynamic phenomena can help us understand their underlying mechanisms and predict future behavior, the  truth is  that  large-scale  measurements  are a mixed  blessing.   Increasing  the  volume and complexity of available data presents increasing challenges to extracting meaningful information about these systems.  For example, there are now reports of sensors (e.g., the Large Hadron Collider  at CERN) that  produce data at a far higher  rate  than  could possibly  be processed  or stored [1]. Despite the apparent complexity, a core belief of complex systems research is that these systems contain some type of underlying structure that will  permit us to model them in a simpler form and gain functional insight [2].  The toolbox of the physicist (e.g., nonlinear dynamics,  information theory,  statistical  mechanics)  has traditionally  been employed  to  seek  this  structure. In contrast, modern signal processing and machine learning have recently achieved unprecedented gains in extracting information from incomplete or corrupted high-dimensional data by assuming the information of interest can be efficiently described using a . These approaches exploit a combination of tools, including statistical inference, convex optimization, unsupervised learning and differential geometry. While  this  geometric  approach has been extremely  powerful  for uncovering  the  fundamental informational building blocks of sensed data in many applications, these tools are generally designed for “static”  data (e.g., an image) and contain  no dynamic component  that  is  necessary for the study of complex systems.  In addition to contributing to the core of this research area, my research group has been extending these tools to develop fundamentally new approaches to tracking time- varying low-dimensional structure.  This work has shown state-of-the-art results in uncovering the information in time-varying signals, and is the beginning of a framework for uncovering the building blocks of complex dynamics.  Specifically, my lab is working to build a framework for principled methods to measure and track time-varying low-dimensional structure in complex systems.

Indeed, predicting the next season's total precipitation, which is especially critical to populations in arid and semi-arid regions, is still an elusive objective. Similarly, although El Niño affects weather, societies and economies worldwide, we still cannot predict its next occurrence suffciently in advance, nor are we certain about the response of the North Atlantic Ocean, which affects Europe's climate, to global climate change. Yet, we have learned over the past 15 years, that in some important ways climate behavior is, in fact, simple. This simplicity is expressed in the fact that the major qualitative features of natural climate variability phenomena such as El Niño may be attributed to simple mechanisms and may be represented by quite simple models. We know now, for example, that the El Niño warming events in the equatorial Pacifc ocean owe their characteristics to the slow back and forth oscillation of large scale, deep ocean waves between the west and east margins of the equatorial Pacifc Ocean. This led to a simple and very useful \"delayed oscillator\" paradigm for El Niño. We also understand quite a bit now about the thermohaline ocean circulation (THC) which transports warm water to the North Atlantic. This circulation may become unstable under certain circumstances such as glacial climate or global warming, with possible influences on Europe's climate. Much of our present knowledge of the THC, which is based on complex three dimensional global general circulation models, was anticipated as early as 1961 by Stommel, using an ingenuously simple model in which the ocean is represented by merely two boxes. Earth's climate undergoes variability due to different phenomena with time scales from one year to hundreds of millions of years. El Niño induces droughts in Africa and floods in south America every 2 to 7 years; changes to the THC can create anomalously cold or warm climate over the North Atlantic that can last from several decades to a couple of hundred years. Such a change to the THC is one explanation for the \"little ice age\" which resulted in the near abandonment of the Viking settlements in Greenland. Ice ages have occurred every 100,000 years, etc. While each of these climate variability phenomena has been investigated in much detail, the question of why is it that these systems are characterized by simple behavior did not arise so far, nor has it been answered yet. We suggest here that the key is that each of the climate phenomena (El Niño, THC, etc) is (weakly) coupled to the others via mutual . Moreover, each slow time scale climate sub-system, both the variability of a faster one such as to keep its behavior simple, and is also affected by the faster system. These feedbacks and mutual control between different time scales have hardly been explored so far, and will be our focus in this project. between different sub-systems is ubiquitous in designed engineering systems. The fundamental purpose of control in such systems is to enhance robustness and reduce sensitivity to uncertainties or disturbances. E.g., the outside weather may be quite complex and variable, yet the temperature of an air-conditioned room controlled by a thermostat is much simpler and more robust. Now, the rich set of tools that are in use in control engineering to design such feedback systems, can signifcantly enhance the understanding of feedbacks between different climate phenomena. Note that this project is about understanding climate using control tools, and not about controlling climate, which we feel is inappropriate given our still very modest understanding of the inner workings of climate. In order to carry out this research we will build and analyze a hierarchy of models, from detailed and realistic three dimensional models of the ocean and atmosphere and the observations that they require, to idealized conceptual models. Earth's Climate has been very robust over millions of years now, and in particular, the past 10,000 years during which human evolution was exceptionally rapid, were also characterized by an exceptionally stable climate. It is now understood that designed systems (in Engineering) or evolved systems (in the natural world) which are robust to certain expected perturbations, are often very fragile with respect to unexpected perturbations. We are clearly now facing an unexpected perturbation to the climate system: the atmospheric CO2 levels in 100 years will be the highest they have been during the past thirty million (!) years. Having reformulated the climate feedbacks and interactions in the language of control theory, we will thus examine the robustness of coupled climate phenomena to expected perturbation (natural climate variability), versus a possible fragility with respect to unexpected perturbations such as global warming. I have been working on the different climate variability phenomena mentioned above for some 15 years, and have always been fascinated by this apparent simple behavior of such a highly complex system. I have been talking to numerous people from different disciplines about this problem, in search for some appropriate methodology. My Caltech collaborator and I are very excited about the potential opportunity opened by the application of tools from control theory and engineering to the climate system. Part of this project will involve the organization of a frst joint workshop of control scientists and engineers with climate dynamics scientists, in order to explore possible interactions of these two communities. Engineers and scientists have inherently different view points, and often don't see things eye to eye. However, Control engineers such as my Caltech collaborator are used to communicating and helping specialists from other disciplines. The climate issues to be studied in this project are clearly highly relevant to people's life, and have important societal and economical implications. Doug and I are therefore looking forward to working together toward a better understanding of what controls the behavior of these natural climate systems, their robustness, and perhaps most importantly, their potential fragility with respect to human actions.

The most common form of brain cancer is malignant glioma  highly invasive, non-curable and neurologically destructive tumors that, in its most advanced form, Glioblastoma Multiforme, (GBM) carries a median survival of less than one year. In contrast to many other tumor types, countless clinical trials have failed to extend the life of GBM patients. The proposed program rests on the premise that meaningful therapeutic in-roads begin with a more in-depth view of the genetic lesions responsible for the genesis, progression and maintenance of GBM. With such knowledge in hand, it will be possible to conceptualize the rational design of therapies directed specifically to these essential genetic lesions. The remarkable success of the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec) has validated the concept of molecularly targeted cancer therapy and has galvanized the cancer research community. Dr. Chins research program has focused on the discovery of cancer genes as well as on the development of mouse models of human cancer. Employing high-resolution technologies to scan across the chromosomes of cancer cells, the Chin laboratory has discovered a number of novel genes that are up-regulated in GBM. One such gene appears to be active in greater than 95% of GBM, making it one of the most consistent genetic lesions in this cancer type. Recent functional analysis of the product of this gene has revealed that it lies at the nexus of pathways governing cellular proliferation, cellular survival and cellular disintegration (necrosis). Over-expression of this gene endows normal brain cells (astrocytes) with enhanced growth rates, intense resistance to chemotherapy, and propensity to undergo necrosis. Indeed, hyperproliferation, chemoresistance and necrosis are hallmark features of GBM, raising the possibility that this gene may drive these stereotypical features. In this proposal, Dr. Chin aims to dissect in great detail the biochemical and physical properties of this novel glioma oncoprotein and to generate mouse models in which to study the impact of overexpression and elimination of function. These biochemical studies will explore this genes interactions with the proliferative and survival machinery of the cell. The mouse engineering will exploit existing approaches, used extensively in Dr. Chins lab, to introduce engineered genes into the mouse germline. These modified mice will be combined with other genetic lesions that promote glioma formation in order to validate the cancer-promoting actions of this new oncoprotein. In the final phases of this program, this validated target will be the focus of high-throughput drug screens designed to identify small molecule inhibitors of protein that will ultimately be assessed in the gliomaprone mice that over-express the gene.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020037\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Additionally, NF2 gene mutation is one of the most common causes of benign brain tumors. These facts alone suggest that the NF2 tumor suppressor is a powerful regulator of tumor cell proliferation yet the normal function of the NF2 tumor suppressor protein remains unknown. There are four main types of tumors that are caused by mutation in the NF2 gene, including schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas. Any type of NF2 gene mutation (truncating or missense) results in the loss of the NF2 gene encoded tumor suppressor protein, known as either schwannomin or merlin. When tumors occur sporadically (in an individual who does not possess an inherited NF2 gene mutation), schwannomas always lack schwannomin, while various studies have shown that roughly 50% of meningiomas, 10% of ependymomas, and some astrocytomas lack schwannomin. Mutation in the NF2 gene therefore is not always causative for sporadic meningiomas, ependymomas and astrocytomas. However these tumor types are also prominent in the spectrum of tumors found in patients with inherited NF2 mutations demonstrating the global importance of the NF2 gene to tumor suppression. Interestingly, recent investigations have also demonstrated that a subset of malignant mesotheliomas are also caused by NF2 mutation. Familial NF2 is a debilitating disorder affecting one in 40,000 individuals worldwide. Individuals with NF2 develop multiple tumors of the nervous system requiring surgical intervention, and NF2 nearly always results in death. The hallmark feature of NF2 is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and excision of these tumors is often associated with loss of hearing in both ears. Additionally, meningiomas (tumors of the brain lining) and other schwannoma types affecting the skin and spine are common. Ependymomas and astrocytomas occur less frequently in NF2 patients than do meningiomas. NF2 patients also frequently develop cataracts and other ocular abnormalities. Since 1995 the research conducted in our laboratory has been steadfastly focused on identifying the function of the NF2 tumor suppressor protein by using a variety of experimental methods designed to determine the identities of other proteins in the cell with which schwannomin interact. While the identity of the NF2 gene has been known since 1993, research on schwannomin function has only partly divulged its normal function. It is clear that schwannomin is a member of a class of proteins that stabilize the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton (a lattice-like structure to which other proteins are bound which when destabilized causes proliferative changes). Our past work has determined that one important cytoskeletal protein known as beta spectrin interacts with schwannomin and that this interaction is important for cytoskeletal organization. We have also demonstrated that schwannomin interacts with HRS, a protein involved in attenuating growth factor signaling, and are actively working on elucidating the functional significance of this interaction. Other laboratories have also made significant progress on the function of schwannomin. Briefly, schwannomin (or merlin) interacts with CD44, NHERF, paxillin, RhoGDI, and with three members of the ERM family of proteins to which schwannomin belongs as well. While each of these interactors suggest cellular pathways regulated by schwannomin, none of the pathways related to these interacting proteins has been verified as being altered in patient tumors. The NF2 pathway of pathogenesis remains unknown. We discovered a new schwannomin interacting protein called p110 that is a member of a complex of eight to ten proteins known as the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). It is well documented that the initiation of protein synthesis in the cell requires the actions of eIF3. P110 is required for normal eIF3 function, but the role of p110 in this process is not well described. There is strong evidence linking p110 and cellular proliferation that hints at a possible role for p110 in tumorigenesis. P110 is overabundant in some tumor types (seminomas) and other eIF3 proteins are overabundant in tumors as well (eIF3-p48/Int-6 has been described as an oncoprotein associated with the malignant transformation of mouse mammary cells, and the gene encoding eIF3-p40 is often amplified in both breast and prostate tumors). Like p40, the abundance of p110 can also be abnormally elevated by gene amplification. In fact, the chromosomal region where p110 is encoded in the human genome is prone to duplication, and one study showed that the intact p110 gene was amplified in multiple tissue types associated with disease predisposition. It is our hypothesis that schwannomin has a critical function in specific tissues in regulating p110 activity. The identification of p110 as a schwannomin interacting protein provides a new and exciting avenue for analysis of schwannomin role in tumorigenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that schwannomin and p110 interact directly and colocalize in cultured cells similar to human cells that give rise to schwannomas. We have also obtained preliminary data suggesting that schwannomin can inhibit protein translation. We hypothesize that schwannomin is a regulator of protein translation through its interaction with p110, and the proposed work will thoroughly test this hypothesis. Successful demonstration that schwannomin inhibits protein translation by way of its interaction of p110 will provide new targets for therapy for NF2 and for a variety of brain tumors in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2003', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In an era of virtually costless communication, increasingly rapid transport, multinational corporations, international terrorism, and global epidemics, the networks that connect us are too vital, and in some ways too dangerous, merely to be wondered at. This heightened sense of connectivity reflects itself in both the public discourse and academic journals. With several hundred papers published in the last five years, the study of networks is a rapidly developing area of interdisciplinary science, spanning fields from physics to sociology. Central to this enterprise is a set of as-yet unresolved questions about the structure of large-scale social networks and their role in driving social behavior. How do networks of sexual relationships, for example, differ from networks of friendships or business ties? What psychological and social characteristics influence the formation of relationships in the first place? How important are social networks in shaping labor markets, or enabling business firms to innovate? To what extent is the success or failure of a new technologyor a new book, movie, or TV showdriven by interpersonal versus media influences? In shaping the outcome of events, how important are so-called \"opinion leaders\" and \"connectors\" versus otherwise ordinary people who happen to hold opinions? Social scientists, journalists, and public intellectuals have debated these questions for decades. Yet the answers have proven elusive, for three reasons: empirical data that describes network ties and their influence on behavior is prohibitive to collect manually; the complexity of theoretical models defies both intuition and traditional analytical methods; and large-scale experiments are virtually impossible to conduct in laboratory settings. While these difficulties remain daunting, the power of modern computing and communication technologies is beginning to yield access to the social world as never before. In the era of the Internet, every email sent and every comment posted leaves an electronic trace that, woven together with a multitude of other messages, transactions, and referrals, portrays a vast and ever changing tapestry of social organization from the level of individuals (who are my friends?) to that of whole societies (how is the world connected?). Ten years ago, such a wealth of sociometric data was scarcely imaginabletoday it is so commonplace, it passes almost without notice. Yet it presents social scientists with an unprecedented opportunity for empirical research. By tracking the evolution of the email interaction network of a large university community (comprising about 40,000 individuals), we shall begin to fill in what we see as a significant gap in the theory of social networks. Millions of individual decisions made by thousands of students, faculty, and staff as they enter (or leave) the community, develop (or terminate) associations with one another, and choose which groups to belong to (or avoid), aggregate into macroscopic patterns that are invisible to the individuals who create them and largely independent of personal idiosyncrasies. In studying truly large-scale, evolving networks, we hope to shed light on the interplay between social networks on the one hand, and on the other hand, the social dimensions (race, income, geography) and contexts (academic, extracurricular, residential) that characterize the university experience. The ability of modern computers to crunch unimaginably large numbers extends beyond empirical analysisit has also revolutionized our ability to build and explore theories about the world. While it is standard in social sciences to develop models of individual behavior based on intuition, experience, and laboratory experiments, the collective behavior of large groups defies conventional methods. Mobs sometimes riot and loot, but other times remain peaceful. Bad economic news may cause investors to scramble en masse towards the exits, but often leaves them unruffled. Outbreaks of infectious disease sometimes spread globally, but often remain localized. In many cases, the difference between wildly divergent outcomes derives not from the characteristics of the individuals themselves, but from their interactions. A critical component of our project is the development of mathematical network models. These models, while still quite simple to write down, exhibit features that are beyond the predictive capabilities of conventional pencil-and-paper mathematics; hence we simulate their development on computers, measuring their statistical properties and comparing them to realworld data. Finally, the technology of the Internet affords us the capability to conduct experiments on a scale far larger than is possible in the traditional laboratory setting. Inspired by the early work of social psychologist Stanley Milgram, we have adapted his \"small world method\" to the Internet ( ). By studying what we call \"social search\"in which individuals search for remote \"targets\" by forwarding messages to acquaintances whom they consider closer to the targetwe can explore the role of social networks in facilitating purposeful action. What is remarkable about social search is that it is fundamentally a collective activity: no individual has enough information to direct a message all the way from its origin to the target, but chains succeed anyway; hence the chains somehow \"know\" more than the individuals who create them. While the intelligence required to conduct social search still resides in people, the key to harnessing it lies in the network. By conducting a series of social search experiments, we hope to understand better the structure of global social networks, and also how individuals perceive and manipulate that structure. Networks are a critical part of social realitycarrying information, transmitting disease, and providing access to resourcesand they have long been recognized as such. But if we are to penetrate the surface of this observation, it will require a coordinated approach between theory, simulation, data, and experiment. We propose to take just such an approach, and in so doing contribute not only to network analysis, but also more broadly to social science and policy.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Columbia University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020054\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '448,575', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Loss of accurate spatial perception is devastating to patients who have had damage to the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex, the part of the human (and monkey) brain that analyzes space. Unlike other aspects of sensation, spatial perception is supramodal: we know where things are not only by looking at them, but also by hearing them, feeling them, or as even Shakespeare knew, smell them. In , Regan tells the newly blinded Gloucester to \"smell his way to Dover.\" It was apparent to 19th century neuroscientists like Herman von Helmholtz and James Hughlings Jackson that the visual perception of space required two things: knowledge of where an object lies on the retina, and knowledge of where the retina is in space. The first step in understanding where the eye is in space is knowing where it lies in the orbit, and that means that the brain must get a position signal of some kind from the eye. The source of the eye position signal is not known. It could arise in two ways. One source is , an 'efference copy' or 'corollary discharge' that might arise from some eye position signal ultimately used to drive the oculomotor neurons which control the muscles when they rotate the eye. Helmholtz proposed this theory in the 19th century. The second source is , a direct signal from specialized cells within the muscles themselves, that signal the length of the muscle back to the brain. These cells are called proprioceptors. Since muscles move the eye by changing their own length, anything that senses muscle length will automatically sense the position of the eye in the orbit. In the skeletal muscles, proprioceptors are well understood: they are called muscle spindles, and have a specialized structure that includes a separate muscle fiber that controls their length, allowing them to work continuously through the range of action of a muscle. One section of the parietal lobe, called the primary somatosensory cortex, has a representation of the length of every muscle, an arrangement which lets humans know where their arms and legs are. The most common proprioceptive structure in the primate eye muscles is the palisade ending, which has its own muscle fiber, like the skeletal muscle spindle. The palisade ending fibers travel in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, the major nerve carrying sensation from the eye and skin above it to the brain. There is abundant evidence for eye position signals in various areas of the visual cortex. Neurons in the posterior parietal cortex report eye position in the dark. More commonly, the responses of visual neurons themselves are often affected by the position of the eye in the orbit. This observation, first made in the posterior parietal cortex has been replicated in a number of visual areas, even the lateral geniculate nucleus, the earliest visual nucleus in the brain. Neuroscientists have assumed that this phenomenon is important in the generation of spatially accurate behavior. The source of this eye position signal is unknown, although conventional wisdom suggests it comes from an outflow signal. It is possible, however, that the eye position signal modulating the visual response could arise from a proprioceptive signal. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, whose responses are modulated by eye position, also have their visual responses modulated by the position of head on the body. It is clear that neck proprioception is responsible for this head-position-induced modulation of visual responses. By extension it is possible that the eye-position modulation of visual responses also arises from a proprioceptive input, in this case from oculomotor muscle proprioception. We know that oculomotor proprioceptors project to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the first way station in the somatosensory pathway. It is not a great leap to assume that they join the rest of the trigeminal system, projecting to the ventral posteromedial thalamus, and thence to the primary somatosensory cortex, . I propose to find and describe the representation of eye position in the primary somatosensory cortex of the Rhesus monkey, whose basic visual, oculomotor, and somatosensory processes are very similar to those of humans. The cortical representation of oculomotor proprioception has never been described, nor has it ever been postulated in the literature. Even the speculations of Büttner-Ennever and Horn (2002) on the function of oculomotor proprioception stop at the superior colliculus, a brain center far more primitive than the cerebral cortex. Nonetheless it is difficult to imagine that the oculomotor proprioceptive system would be the only proprioceptive system without a cortical representation. The representation must be there. The experiments proposed are first to find the representation of eye position in somatosensory cortex, then to establish that it indeed comes from proprioception and not from a motor command, and finally to determine the role of this representation in the generation of the other cortical eye position signals. If oculomotor proprioception is the primary mechanism by which eye position modulates the responses of visual neurons, then the current hypotheses of how the brain analyses space will have to be totally revised. Understanding the nature of spatial perception will give insight into the processes lacking in humans who have deficits in spatial perception. Such deficits can arise developmentally, as in Williams Syndrome, or as the result of strokes or tumors affecting the parietal lobe. Understanding these processes may ultimately lead to the design of better rehabilitative strategies for these devastating conditions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Columbia University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020047\\n', 'year': '2003', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

For example, an engineer might design a new shingle to minimize energy consumption in a building. The engineer must make decisions about the design in the face of uncertainty. Often the engineer uses a mathematical model to predict the performance of various design choices, knowing that these model predictions will not be perfectly accurate due to a lack of full understanding of the relevant physics. After selecting a preliminary design, the engineer may build a prototype part and measure the actual performance. If the performance does not match the prediction, the model may be refined using the new information gained via the measurements. The new model can then be used to update the design and build a new prototype. Such is the iterative nature of human-directed design. Human-directed designs do not match the level of complexity present in biological systems. A modern microprocessor is an extremely sophisticated engineering triumph, yet it cannot rival the flexible and robust behavior of the human brain. One characteristic feature of human-directed design is the limited number of options that are considered simultaneously. In the face of imperfect models (as all models are), the engineer desires to intuitively reason out the individual effect of each design parameter. As a result, the most complicated human-designed systems, such as a computer or an airplane, are built up from smaller subsystems, which have already been characterized prior to inclusion in the larger system. This hierarchical design framework reduces the complexity of the design process, and therefore also limits the set of possible designs and the final system performance. The aim of the proposed research program is to create materials that embody biological design principles, so that they can learn and adapt to optimize themselves. Biological systems are designed through the simultaneous processes of random mutation and selection. Unlike human-directed design, there is no explicit objective that is externally specified. Biological systems that are best able to survive and replicate persist over time, whereas those that are less fit do not. A community of organisms will, over time, become populated with the organisms that are the most efficient at reproducing themselves, in the face of uncertain external conditions and internal competition for limited resources. The community itself can even be viewed as the evolving species. Its members may eventually differentiate themselves to perform specialized functions, such that the community is more fit to reproduce, to such an extent that the individual members can no longer survive apart from the larger community system. Due to the success of biology in creating complex systems with diverse functionality, biological design principles have been borrowed by human engineers. Two notable examples are genetic algorithms and directed evolution. Both methods are based on mutation and selection, in which the criterion for selection is the desired function of the system. Thus both cases are still human-directed design methods. Directed evolution is applied to an experiment, in which a pool of variants is created via random mutation. For example, a chemical agent can induce random mutations in geneomic DNA. Each new DNA sequence is then characterized, based on its fitness to perform the human-specified function, and a sequence with high fitness is more likely to be included in the next pool. The new pool is copied, mutated again, and re-screened for fitness. At each iteration, the pool is expected to contain, on average, more highly fit sequences. The concept of a genetic algorithm is the same as directed evolution, but now the cycle of mutation and selection is applied to a mathematical model, not an experiment. Each sequence represents a candidate design, and a model is used to predict the fitness of each sequence. Random “mutations” are made to the designs in the pool, and better (higher fitness) designs are more likely to be carried into the next round. The final design corresponds to the sequence in the final pool having the highest fitness. The ideas of random mutation and selection used in directed evolution and genetic algorithms can complement more traditional methods for human-directed design. For example, directed evolution can be applied without the need for a mathematical model of the sequence-fitness relationship. Directed evolution and genetic algorithms both enable the search of a wider set of design options than would be practical with deterministic optimization algorithms, which are likely to find a nearby “locally optimal” design (i.e. incremental change to a preliminary design). Deterministic algorithms that guarantee the true “global” optimum also exist, but the computation required is extremely high, limiting their applicability in large design problems. The design framework we propose here goes beyond this cycle of mutation and selection. Rather, we propose a design framework to create systems that can optimize themselves. We will design into these systems the ability to respond and learn via the mechanisms of mutation and selection. The material could be initially ”trained,” but will continue to learn throughout its lifetime. Traditional human-directed designs yield rigid systems that can only perform the tasks for which they are designed or programmed, and only under conditions assumed during the design phase. Here we aim to create more complex systems that exhibit adaption and robustness, and we describe these systems as “intelligent.” As defined by notions of algorithmic complexity, the intelligence of a system (living or non-living) can be measured by the shortest length of computer code that can reproduce the input-output behavior of the system. Human beings are still arguably more intelligent than any computer that has been built and programmed, so it would be impractical to compute this metric for a person. However, the materials we design and build will be much less complex than a human being, so this metric should be practical here, computed from our system-level models and codes. In particular, we will design intelligent materials composed of peptide building blocks. Since proteins are the building blocks of life, peptides, or “short proteins,” give us a vast array of possible function, but with a discrete number of design choices. There are twenty natural amino acids, and thus 20 number of different peptide sequences of length n. For example, if n = 7, there are over a billion different peptides for us to choose from. A general challenge in protein design is the lack of understanding and models relating sequence to function. This motivates our focus on the simpler case of peptides, and our close coupling of modeling and experiments throughout the project. We will focus our initial designs around assemblies inspired by the cross-β motif, which is a three-dimensional assembly composed of two-dimensional β-sheets, which are themselves composed of (linear, one-dimensional) peptides. Cross-β assemblies possess the ability to catalyze reactions and execute morphology changes in response to environment cues, which may hint at their role in Alzheimer's and other amyloid diseases. Their structural complexity will be used to build algorithmic complexity into our intelligent materials. We will optimize our intelligent material such that it can respond and learn in a way that is beneficial to the goal specified by the human engineer. Two essential features of biological systems that must be included in the material design are reversibility and diversity. Without reversibility, a living system can only move in one direction, and thus cannot flexibly respond to a changing environment - once a move is made, it is impossible to move back. Diversity is equally critical in the design of a complex system. Without diversity, a system can reversibly respond to its environment, but responsiveness alone is not intelligence. Intelligence requires the ability to learn, building additional functionality over time and creating greater robustness to an uncertain environment. We will design our intelligent materials using the framework of dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCL), which have been proposed recently under the umbrella of “systems chemistry.” A DCL is a collection of molecules that can associate in various combinations to create larger molecular assemblies. A DCL is characterized by reversible associations, which enable the overall system to equilibrate, creating a diverse set of species in the library. These libraries have been proposed as a tool for materials design, and also as a model system in which to study origins-of-life chemistry. To date, interesting behaviors have emerged from DCL experiments, but no model predictions, and thus no model-based library designs, have been reported. In the proposed research program we will design the library of initial peptide sequences such that the material will embody selective pressures that align with the human-specified objective. In particular, the assemblies that are most fit should also possess the highest ability to aggregate limited resources and thus be most successful at growth and reproduction. To ground our work, we will initially focus on the interplay between temperature and light, for adaptation to the environmental conditions, as motivated scientific questions about the emergence of life on the prebiotic Earth. However, our design framework is general, and can enable the design of intelligent materials for applications as diverse as alternative energy and disease therapies.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Georgia Institute of Technology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020271\\n', 'year': '2011', 'amount': '449,879', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Yet it is clear that human cognition is strikingly unique. Our technological sophistication, capacity for understanding unobservable mental states, and ability to create and manipulate symbols is unrivalled. Humans engage in behaviors that are exceptional, such as the production of personal ornamentation, language, art and music, and the performance of religious rituals. The distinctiveness of human cognition in the natural world is a puzzle. Humans share more than 99% nonsynonymous DNA sequence similarity with chimpanzees, yet there seems to be an incredible discontinuity in the function of the brain between ourselves and our closest living relatives, the great apes (including orang-utans, gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees). In this context, one of the most important challenges of modern neuroscience is to understand exactly how the unique features of human behavior are mapped onto evolutionary changes in neural structure and are specified at the genomic level. Remarkably, however, aside from the observation that humans have brains that are more than three times larger than expected for a primate of their body size, there are very few studies that explicitly examine how the human brain differs from that of great apes. Defining the human brain phenotype in a comparative context is important because it will reveal the underlying biological basis of our species' novel behavioral capacities and our unique susceptibility to neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. My research is driven by an interest in how brains differ among species, how this variation is correlated with behavior, how it is constrained by the rules of biological form, and how it is encoded in the genome. A complete understanding of human cognition must have very deep roots â€“ tracing genes to phenotypes, following neurobiological changes across the lifespan, and describing evolutionary specializations in humans and our close relatives. My research program has three complementary components. (1) Detailed comparative anatomical studies of brain regions implicated in the most unique cognitive abilities of humans, such as \"theory of mind\" and language; (2) Examination of the costs and benefits of brain size expansion with respect to energetics, neuronal morphology, and cell type distributions; (3) Investigation of the interaction between cerebral architecture and species-specific patterns of life history in humans (e.g., rapid early brain growth, an extended childhood, and a long lifespan).

Ecosystems are rapidly breaking down and changing, exposing habitats, species and resources to highly stressful conditions. Best estimates indicate that the present rates of species extinction are 1,000 to 10,000 times greater than the average over geological time. Because human activity is today's major cause of ecosystem change and loss, researchers are attempting to understand the complex interactions that act to preserve ecosystem stability. With improved knowledge, ways may become available to control ecosystem breakdown and the downswing in landscape and species diversity - or biodiversity. Losses of species and habitats are responsible for desertification, exacerbation of the poverty of local populations and the disappearance of plants, animals and microorganisms whose genetic resources could be essential for ecosystem services and the development of better crops or pharmaceuticals. The structure and dynamics of ecosystems - with their interacting networks of animals, plants, bacteria and resources - are extremely complex. While interacting mechanisms among species and food-web interconnections have been studied extensively, a major determinant of ecosystem health - landscape or habitat richness - has been largely ignored. When global changes induce a downswing in habitat variety, the varied ecological niches providing sites for species growth begin to disappear, leading to local, regional, or even outright extinction of species. Our field studies indicate that landscape, resource and species richness are determined by a few animal or plant species, whose powerful effects are the major determinants of ecosystem structure and dynamics. These species, which we call \"ecosystem engineers,\" would include dam-building beavers in North American forests or various shrubs growing in the Negev desert. The dams create water reservoirs that allow for colonization of new species. The shrubs create soil-mounds increasing water infiltration and accumulation of nutrients used by other species. Without recognizing that the engineers are integral to system function, properties, such as ecosystem stability, bio-productivity, biodiversity and resilience to change cannot be properly modeled or understood. Ecosystem engineers should also be taken into account in conservation, restoration and management practices. Fortunately, the number of keystone ecosystem-engineer species is small, and they are susceptible to theoretical, experimental and observational investigations. In this study, we will probe the roles of plants as ecosystem engineers in drylands, areas where water is the major resource barrier. Our long-term field-research in the Negev provides evidence for the existence of several vegetative ecosystem engineers and demonstrates their impact on resource flow and species richness. These studies found that cyanobacteria and shrubs modulate the landscape, the former, by forming soil crusts, which generate runoff, and the latter, by creating soil mounds, which increase water infiltration. These processes maintain the variety and abundance of herbaceous species growing in the ecosystem. In the northern Negev, where mean annual rainfall is about 200 mm, we have estimated that the engineers enable as many as 300 species to populate the area rather than only 25, in their absence.  Along with field studies, theoretical progress in understanding landscape modulation by ecosystem engineers has also been achieved. Our recent mathematical models for vegetation growth in water-limited systems suggest that vegetative ecosystem engineers, such as trees and shrubs, may self-organize into a variety of spatial patterns. These range from bare soil at low rainfall, via spot, stripe and gap patterns as precipitation increases, to uniform vegetation at high rainfall. These patterns dictate soil-water distributions that are vital for the survival of other species. However, a comprehensive theory elucidating the relationship of such landscape modulation and its attendant resource distribution to biodiversity has not yet been proposed. With the aid of the James S. McDonnell Foundation, we expect to develop a comprehensive theory that ties the concept of ecosystem engineers to the appearance of vegetation patterns and elucidates the relationships among landscape modulation, resource distribution and biodiversity. The theory will be developed for the case model of waterlimited systems and will be backed up by experiments and field studies along a 500-km rainfall gradient in Israel ranging from 100 to 900 nun mean annual precipitation. In the future, the principles we develop could be applied to other terrestrial ecological systems such as forests, which are nutrient or light controlled. Our studies will develop novel mathematical models of water-vegetation dynamics along with algorithms for the estimation of species richness. These models will be used to simulate ecosystem-engineer patterns along the rainfall gradient at various topographies and under different disturbance regimes, such as grazing, vegetation clear-cutting, fires and drought. We will identify mechanisms leading to high pattern diversity, including spatial chaos, and investigate the resource niches they create for other species. The algorithm will be used to correlate resource niches to species richness, and to relate global changes affecting ecosystem engineer patterns, to species loss events. In order to assess the reliability of our models and algorithms, it is essential that their predictions can be confirmed on natural and experimental ecosystems. Israel is the ideal place to carry this out as we have six long-term ecological research sites, running from the central Negev desert in the south to the rainy north; they represent extreme desert, dry shrub-land and Mediterranean woodland ecosystems. In addition, we have the same ecosystem engineer, white asphodel (Asphodelus ramosus), occupying the entire range, enabling the verification of our theoretical approach over an extremely broad band of resource levels. This is the first modeling effort to elucidate the role of ecosystem engineers in maintaining biodiversity, and the first attempt to experimentally relate ecosystem-engineer resource modulation to species richness. This investigation will help identify how global changes, resulting from climate and land use, will affect the engineers' operation and therefore biodiversity. It will also be important for conservation ecology and for restoration ecology if a key engineering species becomes extinct due to human-induced disturbances. The unified theory to be developed is expected to uncover previously unknown processes operating in the organization and control of life supporting systems and to suggest new ways of ecosystem management.

Included are astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, which are classified by the WHO as Grade I to Grade IV [1]. Grade IV glioblastoma (GBM), the highest grade astrocytoma and the one with the worst prognosis, can be further separated into primary and secondary GBM. Primary GBM appears , with no prior history of a lower grade tumor, whereas secondary GBM develops following a prior diagnosis of a lower grade astrocytoma. Combined, Grade II, Grade III, and secondary Grade IV gliomas are collectively referred to as progressive gliomas. Recently, a large-scale genome-wide analysis was completed in GBM tumor samples revealing the presence of mutations in at the codon for amino acid residue 132 in 12% of GBMs studied [2]. Further studies revealed heterozygous mutations of either isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) at residue 132 or of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) at the homologous residue 172 in 60-90% of progressive gliomas, including secondary glioblastomas, but not primary glioblastomas [3-9]. The high frequency of these mutations in progressive gliomas is strongly suggestive of a key role in gliomagenesis. Nonetheless, it remains unclear what the role of these mutations in the formation of gliomas is. Normally, IDH1 and IDH2 (collectively referred to as IDH1/2 in this application) catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate while reducing NADP to NADPH. Whereas IDH1 localizes to the cytosol and peroxisomes [10-12], IDH2 localizes to the mitochondria [13]. The potential consequences of IDH1/2 mutations are two-fold. First, mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 may lead to a decrease in wild-type activity [5, 6, 14]. Secondly, these mutations lead to a novel function- namely, the conversion of α¬ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate and the oxidation of NADPH to NADP [15]. Nonetheless, the ramifications of the presence of the mutant enzyme or the new metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate on the cellular phenotype are still being unraveled. The Warburg effect, in which there is an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis, is recognized as a common feature of cancer cells [16],[17], and is particularly prominent in GBM [18]. Increased glycolysis may provide an advantage to a dividing cancer cell by providing not only energy but also basic metabolites required by a rapidly dividing cell [17]. It is possible that mutations in IDH1/2 may provide a mechanism for initiating this shift in metabolism, by altering the levels of key metabolites needed in a rapidly growing cell [19]. The changes in metabolites and related pathways are still being elucidated. Studies looking at the effect of mutant IDH1/2 in leukemias, the only other tumor type in which they are present to any large degree, have suggested that the presence of the mutant protein may inhibit hematopoietic differentiation via changes in DNA methylation status [20, 21]. Nonetheless, it is unclear if the same phenotype is observed in gliomas. One of the paradoxes in the study of glioblastomas is that patients with mutant IDH1/2 tend to have improved survivals compared to patients with wild-type IDH1/2 (citation needed). It has been proposed that this may be due to an increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Mutant IDH1/2 can potentially lead to decreases in NADPH through its active depletion. NADPH is necessary for the reduction of glutathione, which serves to protect the cell against oxidative stress (reviewed in Hammond [22]).Studies have shown that, in fibroblast, leukemia, and other cell lines, increased IDH1 levels lead to an increase in the ratio of reduced glutathione to total glutathione [23, 24], and appear to provide protection against oxidative damage [25-27]. Interestingly, studies using the addition of 2-hydroxyglutarate in vitro to cerebral cortex lysates from young rats show an increase in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [28]. These studies provide two different mechanisms through which mutant IDH1/2 may lead to increased oxidative stress- decrease in native IDH1/2 activity with a concomitant increase in 2-hydroxyglutarate. Currently available glioma cells lines do not have endogenous IDH1/2 mutations, and generating lines from tumors which have mutant IDH/2 has proven challenging. Studies involving artificial introduction of mutant IDH1/2 to currently available glioma cell lines may not yield useful data, as these tumors did not require IDH1/2 for tumor formation. Even if gliomas lines with mutant IDH1/2 were available, there would be some shortcomings. As IDH1/2 mutation is an early event, its largest effect may be on tumor initiation, something which would be challenging to study in established glioma lines. Thus, it is necessary to develop a good system in which to study the effects of mutant IDH1/2. Because these are among the earliest changes in progressive gliomas, it is possible that these changes occur in a precursor cell that is common to both oligodendrogliomas and progressive astrocytomas. A cell that is in a more undifferentiated state may have a unique response to the changes induced by the presence of mutant IDH1/2 compared to a more differentiated cell. To study the effect of mutations in in undifferentiated cells, we have generated mouse ES cell lines that stably express IDH1 or IDH2 . These lines provide a unique opportunity to assess the effects of mutant IDH1/2 on cells in a less differentiated state with a comparable wild-type line as a control. We will use these lines to address the following two hypotheses: 1) Mutations in IDH1/2 lead to changes in metabolic pathways, leading to increased oxidative stress and a dependence on glutamine for survival. 2) Mutations in IDH1/2 alter the normal DNA methylation patterns, leading to inhibition of normal differentiation. Additionally, we hypothesize that mutation of either IDH1 or IDH2 is sufficient to promoter tumor formation. Using these mouse ES cell lines, we will generate mice to assess for the ability of mutant IDH1/2 to form tumors. These mice will also give us the opportunity to observe early tumor development, and will be the first genetically faithful model system in which to study progressive gliomas. These studies will provide key insights into the role of mutant IDH1/2 in the development or progression of tumors by identifying key alterations in metabolic pathways and the ramifications on cellular phenotype and response to stressors. This understanding will allow us to begin to target treatments towards those changes which are specific to cells with mutant IDH1/2. Additionally, mice with mutant IDH1/2 provide a unique in vivo system in which to study the formation of progression of these tumors. Progressive gliomas are highly invasive tumors, which likely interact a great deal with the surrounding parenchyma. This in vivo system will allow us to study progressive gliomas in a system which most closely mimics tumors as seen in human patients, and provides a potential system in which to begin to address ways to treat this devastating disease.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Duke University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2011', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

During episodic recall, the content of memory evolves internally without assistance from environmental cues (Tulving 1972; Squire, 1992). It has been conjectured that the recall process involves linking neuronal assemblies into temporal \"phase sequences\" (Hebb, 1949) but studying the neuronal mechanisms of episodic recall has remained elusive because of the difficulties in accessing the content of free recall in animals (Kahana, 1996; Howard et al., 2005; Süddendorf and Corballis, 1997). Some theorists suggest that episodic memory is strictly a human characteristic because recalling the content of episodes requires verbal communication (Tulving, 1972; Süddendorf and Corballis, 1997). This proposal challenges that claim and suggests to examine the presence of cell assembly sequences in the brain as a potential substrate of episodic memory in rats. Most physiological studies in animals suggest that the hippocampal system serves spatial navigation (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). It has been tacitly assumed that 'place' cell sequences in the hippocampus (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky 1971) result from serially ordered environmental stimuli as the animal traverses through space (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). However, some recent observations are at odds with the view that hippocampal cells simply respond to sensory inputs conveyed by the entorhinal cortex (Hafting et al., 2005). For example, hippocampal neurons signaling selectively the future or past segments of travel have been reported (Wood et al., 2000; Frank et al 2000; Fertinteanu and Shapiro, 2003; Bower et al., 2005). The sequences of place cells at the seconds scale are replicated within single cycles of hippocampal theta oscillations, and the distance representations between place fields are reflected by the spike time differences at these short temporal scale (Skaggs et al., 1996; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006). Finally, the hippocampus is known to generate self-organized patterns during sleep and immobility and the temporal recruitment of neurons within these patterns is related to the assembly sequences during waking experience (Buzsaki, 1989; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994). The and frameworks of assembly sequences have distinct predictions. Consider that the rat is \"frozen\" in space while the theta oscillation mechanism is maintained. According to the map-based navigation theory (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978; Huxter et al., 2003; O'Keefe and Burgess, 2005; Hafting et al; 2005) hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells that are explicitly anchored to specific constellation of landmarks of the environment should display sustained activity while neurons representing other spatial positions should remain tonically suppressed. In contrast, if assembly sequences are generated by internal mechanisms, hippocampal neurons are expected to display an ever-changing activity even when environmental inputs are fixed and body cues are kept stationary, as is the hypothesized case during recall of episodic information. The experiments of this proposal are designed to confront the above predictions by examining the activity of hippocampal and entorhinal neurons in a custom-designed hippocampal-dependent delayed alternation in which the environmental and body-derived cues are kept constant.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020148\\n', 'year': '2007', 'amount': '600,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Such models have the potential to facilitate a deeper understanding of the mechanisms associated with tumor initiation and progression and can also be used to develop and test novel therapeutic approaches designed to attack this complex system at various levels. In fact, many of the challenges cancer researchers are facing lie at the intersection of the mathematical and biomedical sciences. The potential for progress is immense; as an example, the popular scientific journal NATURE recently published an article entitled Mathematical Oncology: Caner Summed Up where the authors stated, \"understanding the complex, non-linear systems in cancer biology will require ongoing interdisciplinary, interactive research in which mathematical models, informed by extant data and continuously revised by new information, guide experimental design and interpretation.\"  This article and many others like it, highlight the fact that mathematicians, scientists and engineers must work together with the rest of society to understand and deal with problems arising the biological sciences and in medicine. Often, these issues cannot be fully understood by the experimental approach alone. Mathematical and computational models are increasingly called upon to help piece together the many seemingly unrelated parts of complex systems and cancer is no exception.  Cancer is a distinct type of genetic disease in which not one, but several, mutations are required to drive a wave of cellular multiplication. The continued proliferation of one or more transformed cells eventually forms an avascular tumor. Having no blood vessels of its own, the growing mass obtains vital nutrients such as oxygen and glucose via diffusion from the vasculature in the surrounding normal tissue. As the colony expands, the diffusion of nutrients and the removal of cellular waste products becomes insufficient. Cells on the outer rim of the tumor thrive in the presence of abundant resources while cells in the center are starved. There is often an interior layer of quiescent cells that receive sufficient nutrient for survival but not proliferation. Researches believe that it is this balance between growth on the periphery and death in the center leads to the observed nutrient-limited growth of avascular tumors to a size of a few millimeters in diameter. An avascular tumor therefore can become dormant when growth stops for an indefinite period. However, a tumor can overcome this deficiency by acquiring a blood supply and it does so by inducing neighboring blood vessels to grow towards the tumor through a process known as .  Angiogenesis is a complex cascade of events that involves many sequential steps. The first event associated with tumor-induced angiogenesis (i.e. the angiogenic switch) involves the secretion, by tumor cells, of a wide variety of chemicals known as angiogenic factors. Experimental evidence suggests that this up-regulated expression of angiogenic factors could be in response to deficiencies in oxygen (hypoxia) or glucose (hypoglycemia). These tumor-derived angiogenic factors (TAFs) diffuse throughout the surrounding tissue laying down a chemical gradient between the tumor and the exiting host vasculature. Under the influence of the TAFs, the endothelial cells that line the existing vessels switch from a previously resting, nonregenerating state to a rapidly dividing group of regenerating cells capable of forming new capillary sprouts that can grow at the rate of 1 mm per day. Endothelial cells begin to migrate and accumulate in the region where the concentration of TAFs has first reached a threshold level. The migrating endothelial cells elongate and align with one another to form a solid sprout from the vessel wall. The endothelial cells then produce enzymes that in turn degrade the basal lamina of the parent vessel, allowing the endothelial cell sprouts to move through the disrupted membrane towards the tumor.  The outgrowing sprouts start to re-associate with each other and lead to the formation of tube-like structures. Initially the sprouts are parallel with each other but tend towards each other as they elongate. Neighboring sprouts will eventually fuse together at their tips to form loops ( ), which signal the beginning of circulation of blood. The looped vessels may bud or loops may fuse with other loops until a complex network of vessels develop. Finally this vessel network penetrates the tumor, providing it with the circulatory system and the supply of nutrients that it requires for tumor growth and progression.  Tumor-induced angiogenesis results in the explosive growth of a vascular tumor that is now connected to the body's blood supply and once initiated the process continues indefinitely. True to its metaphor, the War on Cancer is incorporating a standard military technique: cutting off the enemy's supply lines. A growing army of researchers is experimenting with potential drugs aimed not at tumors themselves but at the network of new blood vessels that develop to feed a tumor. Recall that without its own network of blood vessels, a tumor can't grow beyond a harmless few millimeters in diameter. Interrupting tumor-induced angiogenesis is promising avenue for cancer treatment that can lead to tumor regression and possibly cures.  The concept of treating solid tumors by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis was first articulated almost 30 years ago. For the next 10 years it attracted little scientific interest. However, the last decade has witnessed a remarkable transformation in both attitude and interest in tumor angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic drug development. In fact, concentrated efforts in this area of research are leading to the discovery of a growing number of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules which can be targeted against this process, some of which are already in clinical trials. The complex interactions among these molecules and endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix, and how they affect vascular structure and function in different environments are now beginning to be elucidated. This integrated understanding is leading to the development of a number of exciting and bold approaches to treat cancer and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases. Our proposal is aimed at advancing this understanding through a multiscale, mathematical model of sustained angiogenesis and vascular tumor growth.  Mathematical modeling and experimental observations provide substantial evidence that tumor-induced angiogenesis is a multipscale process that is governed by both mechanical and chemical process and that interactions between tumor cells and endothelial cells with the host environment cannot be ignored. Previous modeling investigations of tumor induced angiogenesis have aimed to capture the qualitative feature of the processes involved but fall short in three major areas: (1) all but a few studies ignore the role of the forces generated by endothelial cells on extracellular matrix, (2) none of the previous models consider the role of inhibitors of angiogenesis, and (3) all existing models treat the extracellular matrix as a passive medium for endothelial cell migration, whereas experimental evidence has shown that ECM regulates angiogenesis by providing not only scaffold support, but by serving as a reservoir and modulator for angiogenic growth factors. Now that experimental models are able to account for such processes, which appear to be critical to angiogenesis on the cellular and molecular levels, mathematical models that include these dynamics and address the question of mechanism can be constructed. In addition, anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategies are clinically recognized has having enormous potential in the treatment of cancer. Mathematical modeling of sustained angiogenesis and vascular tumor growth has an increasingly important role in the development and testing of these strategies.  This research will combine mathematical modeling, numerical simulation and in vivo tumor vascularization experiment to gain deeper understanding of angiogenesis, tumor growth and vascular structure. Specifically, by developing such a multiscale tumor vascularization model, we will investigate:", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020079\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '436,735', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Current treatment methods highlight the substantial progress made in patient care in the last two decades while at the same time bring to our attention the major drawbacks of such approaches as well as demonstrate the need for further research efforts.  Medulloblastoma originates within the cerebellum, the region of the brain that controls movement and coordination. Thus, common symptoms are unsteadiness and balance impairment in addition to headaches and vomiting due to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow. Children are usually diagnosed quickly within one to three months of symptoms. However, this is a fast growing tumor that has the tendency to spread rapidly to other sites in the nervous system. Prognosis at later stages is grim especially for very young children or in cases where the tumor has spread to other parts of the brain.  The majority of patients with this disease are treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Because medulloblastoma is a fast growing tumor and has the tendency to spread rapidly to other sites in the brain, extremely aggressive treatments are employed to treat this disease. However, such aggressive treatment approaches, especially in young children, can harm the developing brain and lead to significant learning problems later in life. Indeed, in some cases, the treatment of medulloblastoma is worse than the disease itself. For example, children who undergo surgery to remove the tumor have a better overall rate of survival compared with treatments that only involve radiation and chemotherapy. However, while surgery for children with medulloblastoma has become safer in the past two decades, a significant number of children (20%) will develop severe, and potentially irreversible, neurological problems such as speech loss and severe balance impairment. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that aggressive chemotherapy significantly improves survival for children whose tumors cannot be successfully removed by surgery. However, it is well known that children who undergo such full-dose radiotherapy will have significant learning problems and difficulties in school later in life. Thus, while significant progress has been made, it is clear that only through a better understanding of the biology of this tumor can the goal of curing children with medulloblastoma while simultaneously preserving their quality of life be achieved.  Medulloblastoma is thought to originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors in which the cell growth pathway is aberrantly activated by genetic mutations. However, we are only just beginning to understand the cellular origins and molecular mechanisms underlying this tumor. For instance, a molecule called sonic hedgehog (Shh), produced by neighboring cells in the cerebellum, controls growth of cerebellar granule cell precursors during normal development. Cerebellar tumors are thought to arise when the Shh pathway is over activated or when it fails to turn off after the normal phase of cell growth. A major breakthrough in the field has been the discovery that laboratory mice with genetic mutations in the Shh pathway develop tumors that resemble human medulloblastomas. These mice have opened up a wide avenue of research into understanding the biology of medulloblastoma, especially in studies that would be morally impossible to perform in humans. Even more exciting is the recent identification of new drug compounds such as cyclopamine that specifically inhibit the Shh pathway. Amazingly, treatment of mice (and potentially humans) with this drug significantly inhibits development of medulloblastoma. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that a better understanding of the mechanisms of the Shh pathway in tumorigenesis provide direct translational applications to treating the disease in children.  In our laboratory, we have identified a molecule called Mad3 that appears to be regulated by the Shh pathway in the developing cerebellum. In fact, if we simply produce more of this molecule in a culture system, we can significantly increase the level of cell growth in the absence of endogenous factors. Thus, it appears that Shh may exert its effect on cell growth by activating the mad3 gene. We hypothesize that misregulation of Mad3 by Shh leads to uncontrolled cell growth of pre-tumor cells, the first step in developing medulloblastoma. Mad3 is a transcription factor that can control the expression of a large set of other molecules that are required for cell growth. Indeed, Mad3 target genes as well as Mad3 itself are excellent new drug targets to treat this disease. Therefore, understanding the role of Mad3 in granule cell growth will provide important insights into tumorigenesis that may result in novel therapies to treat medulloblastoma and even other cancers.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Davis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2005', 'amount': '90,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Forbes (1887), The Lake as a Microcosm  Ecological communities are complex systems. They contain hundreds of species that compete for resources, eat each other, and modify their environment. Organisms can have complicated behaviors, and physical and chemical factors influence communities in predictable and random ways. Most communities have open borders, so they receive fluxes of matter and organisms from outside the system. Not only are ecosystems complex, most are also logistically dicult to study, due to their slow dynamics and large sizes. Yet, ecosystems provide valuable services to humans, from natural products to aesthetic properties, and are increasingly disturbed by human activities, so we must improve our understanding of how ecosystems are assembled (what determines the species present) and operate (what controls how nutrients and energy flow among biotic and abiotic pools).  We focus our research on plankton communities. Plankton are the microscopic plants (phytoplankon) and animals (zooplankton) that form the base of food webs in lakes and the oceans. The oceans' phytoplankton play a major role in the planet's carbon cycle since they perform about half the earth's photosynthesis. Zooplankton graze phytoplankton and serve as a conduit for solar energy to higher animals. Phytoplankton affect water quality: some merely cause unsightly blooms, others are toxic to humans and animals. Humans impact aquatic ecosystems by introducing nonnative species, overharvesting commercially valuable species, changing natural hydrological patterns, and polluting them with excess nutrients. A better understanding of what determines the abundance and composition of plankton communities in space and time will improve our ability to predict how aquatic ecosystems will respond to these human perturbations.  Aside from their direct importance to people, plankton communities are ideal systems for exploring ecological complexity, as Forbes noted over a century ago. Though we can't see most plankton with the naked eye, a microscope reveals a diverse and fascinating community. Plankton grow quickly, so processes that would take decades in forests occur in weeks in lakes. Plankton are easily grown in the lab, allowing us to measure physiological parameters. By studying plankton communities as model systems, we hope to illuminate processes that may also structure other, less tractable ecosystems.  \" \" - Naiman et al. (1995), The Freshwater Imperative: A Research Agenda  Our main goal is to develop and test new theoretical approaches to understanding the assembly and operation of plankton communities. We want to know how many and what types of species will be present in a particular lake, given knowledge of its abiotic characteristics such as depth and nutrient content. Traditional models in ecology determine the outcome of interaction between a few predefined species, predicting whether the species will coexist and if so, what their abundances will be. It's like being able to predict the outcome of a boxing match between two particular fighters. The problem is that an ecosystem is much closer to a barroom brawl than an orderly boxing match, with large numbers of species assailing each other simultaneously. The models we will develop determine which species will be left standing in a particular ecosystem after the dust settles. In our approach community structure emerges from the interaction of all possible species rather than being presupposed by the particular species chosen at the outset.  Our approach is based on recent developments in evolutionary game theory. We define a universe of possible species in terms of their ecological strategy: how good they are at acquiring different resources, avoiding predators, and so on. We derive an invasion function that tells us which species can invade an existing community, then look for some species or combination of species that can keep all others out. This set of species represents a stable endpoint of community assembly and is the type of community we'd expect to find in the field. We repeat this process for different types of environments to see how communities depend on the abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem.  These models meet the real world in a few ways. First, we will perform a series of physiological experiments on different species to determine the trade-offs between traits that define the universe of possible species. These physiological studies provide the raw material that the models transform into predictions of how community organization depends on environmental conditions. We will test these predictions against an extensive set of field data collected by the EPA in the 1970's that has been largely forgotten. We expect a continuous interplay between these studies so that new empirical discoveries will also guide model development. Often theoreticians and empiricists work in isolation from each other. Integrating laboratory, field, and theoretical approaches provides a powerful method to understand ecological complexity.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Michigan State University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020090\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '449,965', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

To understand comprehension, thinking, and decision-making we must consider the role knowledge plays. We need to know about the content of knowledge, its structure, how it is retrieved, and how it is used in context. We do not have, however, an adequate model of human knowledge. In the absence of such a model, researchers have taken shortcuts: they have used hand coded knowledge structures as they needed them in their models of comprehension, problem solving, analogical reasoning, concept learning, and decision making. That is certainly a defensible strategy and has been used widely and often successfully by just about every theorist and model builder in cognitive science. However, the time has come when we can do better than that. Although we still lack a comprehensive theory of knowledge, and probably won’t have one for some time, promising beginnings have been made. In recent years, developments in cognitive science and machine learning have made it possible to build statistical models of meaning that serve as useful tools for modeling higher-order cognitive processes, and that can lead to successful practical applications as well. The model that we have worked with in the past to simulate human verbal knowledge is Latent Semantic Analysis or LSA. The input to LSA is a very large corpus of text, such as 11M words from books and articles that a typical high-school graduate might have read. From this corpus LSA constructs automatically a map of word and text meanings. As in a geographic map, words and texts are represented as points in space at various distances from each other and in the correct spatial relationship. However, about 300 dimensions are required to map semantic relations in such a way that they resemble human meaning. Once the map is constructed, it can be used to rapidly estimate distances among words or documents, or conversely, similarities. Such a map of meaning is extremely useful in mind/brain research. Since it is based on a large amount of natural text, it represents semantic relations in accordance with their real-world significance. A large number of studies using LSA are reported in a book in press, edited by Landauer, McNamara, Dennis, & Kintsch, that explore the ability of LSA to model human semantic judgment and performance, as well as its limitations. A major limitation of LSA is that in constructing its map of meaning it uses only information about which words appear in a document, but disregards information about their syntactic relations. We are now able to overcome this limitation, that is, to construct semantic representations that take into account the syntactic relationships among the words in a linguistic corpus. This is a major advance in the field of statistical semantics. There are as yet very few systems capable of dealing with syntactic structure, and they tend to be computationally expensive. What is proposed here is simple and robust, and we believe it will prove sufficient to model the role of syntax in everyday sentence comprehension (as distinguished from expert linguistic analysis). Statistical models of meaning, whether they include structural information or not, represent the meaning of a word as a point (vector) in a semantic space. That is, from observing how that word has been used in many contexts, the model infers a context-free representation of that word. Real words, of course, are different: they often have several meanings and almost always many different senses. Therefore, psychological theories of word meaning are usually framed in terms of a mental lexicon that lists these various meanings and senses. The present approach is different. Instead of a mental lexicon with ready-made meanings, we assume that the lexicon is generative: word meanings are generated in working memory from the stored, context-free semantic representation (e.g., the LSA vector) together with the context in which the word is used. Thus, what is stored in long-term memory is merely a building block for the construction of meaning; meaning must be constructed in working memory in context, and is therefore always contextually appropriate. In our approach, a word has as many meanings as it has uses (many will differ only slightly, of course). The algorithm that generates contextual meanings when one word is used in the context of another word has been explored in Kintsch (2001; in-press); an algorithm for the construction of sentence meanings in working memory is at the core of the present proposal, as sketched in Section 3 above. The model that we are developing here is not only of theoretical interest. A model that can simulate the comprehension of sentence meanings opens up promising areas of application in educational technology. For the past eight years we have elaborated the theory and developed a software system that teaches middle school and high-school students how to write summaries. Summary Street is now employed in 120 classrooms and has been used by over 3,000 students. It is easy and cheap to use over the internet, and it has been shown to be effective. It helps students to compose better summaries, even when they have no longer access to the tool (Wade-Stein & E. Kintsch, 2004; Franzke, Caccamise, E. Kintsch, & Johnson, 2005). We want to build on this work to develop a more broadly useful software for tutoring. Identifying important information to include in a summary is an important strategy for deep comprehension, but not the only one. True learning depends on integrative strategies as well, that serve to elaborate the text content with the reader’s own knowledge. The tool we have in mind will foster deep comprehension by supporting not only text-based processes, but these crucial inferencing processes as well,. The tutor is based on the theory and technology that enabled us to build Summary Street, but advances this approach in important ways. Our early work on LSA was supported by the McDonnell Foundation (1997- 2001); the further development and scale-up work was supported by grants from NSF (ITR and IERI). Our present goal is to design and develop a general comprehension tutor that helps students comprehend difficult texts, and hence to learn from these texts. Much research on how to make students actively engaged readers and better learners suggests that interactions between groups or pairs of students, or classroom interactions with the teacher are effective for learning higher-level comprehension. These interactions work by scaffolding students’ attempts to construct meaning as they read. They introduce the appropriate strategies to the students and serve as a natural diagnosisand hint-providing system: when students’ answers indicate that their understanding is still incomplete, a teacher or peer can continue questioning or provide hints to scaffold their attempts to comprehend and lead them in the right direction. However, welldeveloped classroom management in this manner is expensive and resource consuming. To address the problem of how to help students better understand difficult texts we are proposing to develop a computer-based tutor that will provide guided practice in meaning construction during reading. Such a tutor can be embedded in content area instruction without placing an additional burden on classroom teachers: it can support reading of assigned texts at home or wherever a computer is available. The tutor will focus on middle- and high-school students at a point where such guidance is especially needed, that is, when learning becomes increasingly dependent on reading complex texts. Although our efforts will be initially limited to science topics, the tutor we have in mind is flexible and applicable to a wide variety of knowledge domains. The key to such a tutor is for the computer to be able to understand what the student is saying. That is what this project is designed for. Once we have this ability, we can mimic the diagnosis and hint-providing instruction that has proven so successful in practice, letting the ever-present computer help out where the teacher is unable to provide individualized help. As we have found with Summary Street, such a tutor cannot replace the teacher. Its effectiveness depends on how well the teacher uses it: as just another exercise it will have little effect, but purposefully integrated in classroom instruction it can be a very powerful tool. Thus, the goal of this project is twofold: (1) to advance our understanding of language comprehension by building a better model of the processes involved in comprehension, using novel methods from the machine learning field, and (2) to use our ability to simulate comprehension to build a tutor that makes possible guided practice of deep comprehension through flexible computer-based scaffolds.

Arguing with a friend in the corridor, we fail to notice passing colleagues, people entering and leaving offices, the passage of time. This powerful selectivity has been documented in countless behavioural experiments - a person, for example, who listens carefully to a speech message coming from one loudspeaker knows little or nothing of what is said in another. Selective attention of this sort touches on some of the fundamental problems of human cognition - on how we produce focused, coherent lines of thought and behaviour, and on consciousness itself.  Visual selective attention has also become one of the success stories of cognitive neuroscience. Beyond primary visual cortex, visual information is distributed to a network of cortical areas, together making up the classical cortical visual system. In different parts of this system, neurons work towards different goals - object recognition, visuomotor control, spatial navigation and so on. In many and perhaps most visual areas, experiments in awake, behaving monkeys show the filtering power of selective attention. When the monkey pays attention to some visual input, the neural representation of this input is strong and sustained. When attention is focused elsewhere, the neural signal is attenuated. Such results suggest a direct parallel to the everyday experience of attentional filtering: Central awareness of important information, and loss of much of the remainder. The experiments open the door to a detailed physiological account of brain mechanisms underlying a key aspect of higher cognitive function.  At the same time, we increasingly suspect that monkey studies like these show only one part of the picture. The clue comes from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the human brain. The strength of monkey electrophysiology is the detail with which a neural system can be examined; the strength of fMRI is its ability to measure whole brain activity, and thus to give a broad brush picture of brain processes associated with cognitive functions. In recent experiments, we find that attention does far more than filter processing in the classical visual system. In addition, an attended event is associated with concurrent activity in specific regions of parietal cortex, the frontal lobe, and subcortical structures. For many parts of this attention circuit, equivalent events in the monkey brain are unknown. To begin work on the physiology of this circuit, we propose linked experiments using human fMRI, single unit physiology, and as a direct bridge between the two, fMRI in the awake, behaving animal.  A typical experiment in our human fMRI laboratory works like this. Streams of visual stimuli are shown at two or more locations. The subject is told to attend to stimuli in some locations and to ignore others; in the simplest case, the subject is asked just to watch attended events, with no task to perform or decisions to be made. To make all events equivalent in terms of sensory input, the subject's eyes are always fixed on the centre of a display screen; attended and unattended events occur at various locations around this central fixation point. Using fMRI, we contrast the brain's response to two kinds of input events - attended events, which are consciously seen, and unattended events, which usually are not. As expected, we see that attended events produce stronger activity in large sections of the classical visual system - in particular occipitotemporal regions involved in high-level object recognition. As in the monkey experiments, such results suggest that attention filters neural representations in much of the cortical visual system. Outside the visual system, however, there is a much more extensive pattern of cortical and subcortical activity associated with attended events. Included in this pattern is activity in the parietal lobe (along the intraparietal sulcus), the lateral frontal lobe (posterior part of the inferior frontal sulcus, spreading down to frontal operculum/insula), the medial frontal lobe (anterior cingulate/supplementary motor area), the basal ganglia and the thalamus.  Viewed in terms of human fMRI, this attention circuit has a striking familiarity. As we and others have shown, a very similar activity pattern is associated with a wide range of different kinds of mental activity, suggesting something of central importance to human thought and behaviour. Viewed in terms of monkey physiology, however, this broad attention circuit is essentially unknown territory. We do not know if monkeys too have such broad attentional activity; if they do, we have essentially no physiological information concerning different circuit components and their activity. In our work, we begin to explore this unknown territory - to define the components of an attentional circuit in the behaving animal, and to begin detailed investigation of their physiological properties.  The key link from human to animal studies is monkey fMRI. In our collaborating laboratory (Max-Planck, Tbingen), fMRI has been developed for the awake monkey sitting upright in a vertical-bore magnet. Monkeys are trained to sit still and to tolerate the fMRI environment. In our experiments, monkeys will be trained using methods essentially identical to those in human studies. Streams of stimuli will appear in several locations around a central fixation point. By pre-cueing, animals will be trained to focus attention on one set of locations, waiting for occasional target stimuli but otherwise simply watching the attended stimulus sequence. As in the human studies, the experiments will contrast brain activity associated with attended and unattended stimulus events. In this way, the experiments will ask whether monkeys too show an attention circuit corresponding to human findings. In the parietal lobe, we shall ask what corresponds to extensive human activation along the intraparietal sulcus. In the frontal lobe, we shall seek for correspondences on the lateral frontal surface, in the operculum/insula, and on the medial frontal surface. Subcortically, we shall be able to examine activity of the basal ganglia and the thalamus. Especially for small subcortical structures, the high spatial resolution of the monkey scanner will allow the attention circuit to be defined in substantially greater detail than human experiments can achieve. As these experiments progress, equivalent human studies (MRC, Cambridge) will be used as a direct check on cross-species equivalence.  While the strength of fMRI is breadth of spatial coverage, the strength of electrophysiology is detail. With the results from Tbingen as a guide, in the Oxford electrophysiology lab we shall move on to an expanded view of selected circuit components. From the perspective of monkey physiology, there are several candidates in the human data whose involvement in visual attention is very much of a surprise. In the intraparietal sulcus of the monkey, for example, is a set of subregions with well-known specialization for different aspects of spatial behaviour and visuomotor control. Why should such regions be active for conscious perception of a new visual event - even when attention is fixed on one spatial location and no response choices need be made? Our experiments will examine the physiological properties of parietal neurons in this situation, and examine how such responses differentiate attended and unattended events. In the frontal lobe, similarly, little is known concerning several parts of the human circuit and their potential attentional role. For the anterior cingulate/supplementary motor area, for example, most physiological data concern a role in task and action control. Again, existing data suggest little that could be relevant to visual selective attention. More generally, our experiments will ask how components of an attentional circuit respond to visual events, and how they contribute to the development and maintenance of an attentional focus.  Undoubtedly, monkey experiments have been of great value in beginning to uncover the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive function. For visual attention, however, we think that modulation of activity in the classical visual system is just one part of a much broader set of brain events. With awake monkey fMRI, we can now relate detailed electrophysiology to the kind of circuit overview obtained from human imaging experiments. In our view, the time is right to explore the big picture of brain events underlying selective, conscious perception.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Medical Research Council', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020081\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '449,729', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Thus, common symptoms are unsteadiness and balance impairment in addition to headaches and vomiting due to blockage of cerebrospinal fluid flow. Children are usually diagnosed quickly within one to three months of symptoms. However, this is a fast growing tumor that has the tendency to spread rapidly to other sites in the nervous system. Prognosis at later stages is grim especially for very young children or in cases where the tumor has spread to other parts of the brain. The majority of patients with this disease are treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Because medulloblastoma is a fast growing tumor and has the tendency to spread rapidly to other sites in the brain, extremely aggressive treatments are employed to treat this disease. However, such aggressive treatment approaches, especially in young children, can harm the developing brain and lead to significant learning problems later in life. Indeed, in some cases, the treatment of medulloblastoma is worse than the disease itself. For example, children who undergo surgery to remove the tumor have a better overall rate of survival compared with treatments that only involve radiation and chemotherapy. However, while surgery for children with medulloblastoma has become safer in the past two decades, a significant number of children (20%) will develop severe, and potentially irreversible, neurological problems such as speech loss and severe balance impairment. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that aggressive chemotherapy significantly improves survival for children whose tumors cannot be successfully removed by surgery. However, it is well known that children who undergo such full-dose radiotherapy will have significant learning problems and difficulties in school later in life. Thus, while significant progress has been made, it is clear that only through a better understanding of the biology of this tumor can the goal of curing children with medulloblastoma while simultaneously preserving their quality of life be achieved. Medulloblastoma is thought to originate from cerebellar granule cell precursors in which the cell growth pathway is aberrantly activated by genetic mutations. However, we are only just beginning to understand the cellular origins and molecular mechanisms underlying this tumor. For instance, a molecule called sonic hedgehog (Shh), produced by neighboring cells in the cerebellum, controls growth of cerebellar granule cell precursors during normal development. Cerebellar tumors are thought to arise when the Shh pathway is over activated or when it fails to turn off after the normal phase of cell growth. A major breakthrough in the field has been the discovery that laboratory mice with genetic mutations in the Shh pathway develop tumors that resemble human medulloblastomas. These mice have opened up a wide avenue of research into understanding the biology of medulloblastoma, especially in studies that would be morally impossible to perform in humans. Even more exciting is the recent identification of new drug compounds such as cyclopamine that specifically inhibit the Shh pathway. Amazingly, treatment of mice with this drug significantly inhibits development of medulloblastoma. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that a better understanding of the mechanisms of the Shh pathway in tumorigenesis provide direct translational applications to treating the disease in children. In our laboratory, we have identified a molecule called Mad3 that appears to be regulated by the Shh pathway in the developing cerebellum. In fact, if we simply produce more of this molecule in a culture system, we can significantly increase the level of cell growth in the absence of endogenous factors. Thus, it appears that Shh may exert its effect on cell growth by activating the gene. Importantly, if we take away Mad3, the granule cells no longer proliferate. Thus, we predict that taking away Mad3 in cerebellar tumors may actually inhibit the growth of this tumor in humans. We hypothesize that misregulation of Mad3 by Shh leads to uncontrolled cell growth of pre-tumor cells, the first step in developing medulloblastoma. Mad3 is a transcription factor that can control the expression of a large set of other molecules that are required for cell growth. Indeed, Mad3 target genes as well as Mad3 itself are excellent new drug targets to treat this disease. Therefore, understanding the role of Mad3 in granule cell growth will provide important insights into tumorigenesis that may result in novel therapies to treat medulloblastoma and even other cancers.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of California - Davis', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2006', 'amount': '360,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In those days, there were empty spaces in the maps, labeled as “Terra Incognita”, and the monsters inhabited those blank spaces. As explorations advanced, the maps became more precise, our knowledge better and the monsters vanished. So far, we have no news of their return, and we only see them in old engravings, movies and in our imagination. Somehow, not everything seems possible. However, nature abounds in complex forms and structures and seems to have an infinite power of generating complexity. We are fascinated by their richness and diversity and wonder how such complex entities have evolved. And yet, biological complexity is the result of an apparently inefficient mechanism of change: tinkering. Indeed, evolution operates by extensively re-using previous structures, and it is unable to foresee the future, as an engineer would. For example, proteins used to build the lenses in our eyes are also used somewhere else as enzymes. Genes involved in triggering the death of cells during the formation of fingers in vertebrates are later recruited to participate in the formation of the nervous system. Moreover, engineers can invent a completely new device with no inspiration from previous designs. These differences were pointed out in 1976 by the french biologists François Jacob. His paper received great attention, and his conjecture of understanding evolution as a tinkerer received great support over the last decades, particularly from developmental biology. But the reasons for the great success of tinkering remain essentially unknown. An additional feature of evolution is the presence of widespread convergence: common solutions are found to common problems: Evolution often re-invents similar structures and functional traits by tinkering from available components, as if only some special solutions could be achieved. Such convergent behavior of evolutionary innovations suggests that common rules shape the emergent of complexity in nature, imposing strong limitations to what is possible. What are those? This project involves an exploration of the question of how tinkered evolution generates successful innovations and why these innovations usually converge to common solutions. In order to quantitatively explore this problem, we consider different levels of complexity, from cellular to ecological. All these systems are studied by considering them as a set of many interacting components forming a web. Such web, also known as a complex network, has been shown to display common patterns of organization, often resulting from simple rules of duplication and rewiring. Here by duplication we mean that random copies of already present existing are generated. This can occur through mutations and the resulting redundant copy can afterwards acquire new functions. A given protein for example, is linked to a number of other proteins by physically interacting with them (at some point in time and space). If a mutation occurs such that the gene coding for the protein becomes copied twice and redundant information will be present. But if mutations in the gene occur, they can rapidly modify the repertoire of interactions of the redundant copies and new functions can emerge. In this way, tinkering provides a source of innovation. In a different context, complex ecosystems will change over time by “inventing” new species: here speciation is the mechanism introducing copy, whereas further coevolution introduces changes in the redundant species (through diet specialization, for example). As a result of copy-and-change dynamics, complex networks are generated. The resulting networks display strong similarities, including the presence of small world properties (namely short chains connecting any pair of elements) and heterogeneity: most elements have a few links whereas a handful of them (the hubs) have many connections. Together with these structural properties, tinkered networks (as we call them) exhibit a high fragility under the removal or damage of hubs and a high robustness under random mutations. The presence of these common traits, often measurable in quatitative terms, might pervade the convergent designs found in nature. Understanding the origins of this dual character of tinkering, that is to say its efficiency and limited repertoire, can be achieved by studying the underlying landscapes where these evolutionary paths take place. Fitness landscapes have been extensively used as a powerful metaphor of evolutionary optimization. A landscape has been often visualized as sets of connected valleys and mountains, whose height represent the fitness of a given combination of biologically relevant traits. Evolution would take place by exploring the universe of possible solutions and discarding those having smaller fitness through some selection process. Combinations of traits on the valleys would be rapidly eliminated, whereas those close or on top of mountain peaks would be favoured. Not much is known about the real nature of these landscapes in the real world, and only for RNA molecules a good understanding has been achieved. In this case, the linear RNA sequence, the genotype, folds in space into a given shape. Such shape is the phenotype, which is the link with functionality: a given folded RNA is associated to a given activity. These landscapes have been found to be neutral, meaning that many single mutations do not change the phenotype, and thus leading to neutral changes. Populations in this case spread through landscapes having “flat” domains where no change in fitness is found, followed by rapid changes when some fittest solution is found at the boundaries of the flat region. Our recent work using networks performing computations has shown that such landscapes might be the rule in totally different contexts. Perhaps such universal features pervade the presence of convergent designs. Our project will study the nature of these landscapes associated to tinkered networks, at the cellular, tissue, developmental and ecological levels. They are all connected: cellular networks are responsible for cell differentiation and thus cellular diversity, which is required to generate and sustain efficient tissues. Cell diversity and its spatial organization in tissues are at the heart of development, and we want to see what types of networks allow reliable and flexible development to occur. Finally, an appropriate comparison with the real world needs considering what ecologist Evelyn Hutchinson dubbed “the ecological theater”: phenotypes make sense only if performing their role in a well-defined physical context. A model of development of embodied organisms will be constructed in order to explore the requirements for pattern formation to allow animal diversity to emerge and flourish, and determine the role of emergent dynamics versus selection under tinkered evolution.

When you reach for your coffee, your fingers close just at the time your hand arrives at the cup. If someone pauses too long before answering your question, you wonder about the truthfulness of their response. In speech perception, the only difference between the sound “pa” and the sound “ba” is the voice onset time, the time the vocal cords start vibrating relative to the release of air from the lips. If that time is longer than about 20 ms, we perceive the sound as “pa”; if it is shorter, we perceive “ba.” Since the accurate perception and execution of timing is of critical importance for so many motor and cognitive acts, the brain must have a way of measuring time. This is not a simple task—until the British clockmaker John Harrison produced his “chronometers” in the mid-18th century, the difficulty of building accurate mechanical clocks was the main limitation to navigation. Our experiments ask how the challenge of accurately measuring time is addressed by the biological hardware of the brain. Research on this question suggests that there is no central brain clock; rather, time is measured for different purposes at distributed sites in the brain, including the cerebral cortex (in particular parietal cortex), the basal ganglia, the hypothalamus, the brainstem, and the cerebellum. The neural circuits in these brain regions are able to measure time over a range of different time scales, from microseconds to days. Our research project focuses on the measurement of time in the cerebellum. Previous empirical and theoretical studies suggest that one important function of the cerebellar circuit is the computation of time on a scale of tens of milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, in the support of both perception and action. Functional imaging studies of brain activity in humans have reported activation of the cerebellum during tasks that require subjects to judge the duration of events (time discrimination) and during tasks that require subjects to produce movements with particular inter-response intervals (time production). Additional evidence for a role of the cerebellum in timing has come from studies of human patients with cerebellar lesions. These patients are impaired on time production tasks such as rhythmic tapping and the production of discrete movements with a specified duration, and they are also impaired on time discrimination (for a review, see Ivry et al., 2002; Llinas and Welsh, 1993). Thus, a large body of empirical evidence suggests that the cerebellum computes time in the service of perception and movement. However, the mechanism by which the intricate circuit architecture of the cerebellum performs this computation is still a matter of theory. A compelling model (Medina et al., 2000) proposes that a specific population of interneurons in the cerebellar cortex, called Golgi cells, plays a key role in creating a representation of time in the cerebellum. This model suggests that the pattern of interconnectivity between the Golgi cells and the input neurons of the cerebellar cortex, the granule cells, causes different subsets of granule cells and Golgi cells to be sequentially activated in response to a constant input to the cerebellum. In this way, the specific pattern of active granule cells and Golgi cells could indicate, not just whether a particular cerebellar input is present (reflecting the presence of a particular sensory stimulus), but also how long that stimulus has been present. Downstream neurons could use this neural representation of the time since stimulus onset to appropriately time the motor response to the sensory input. One can imagine that the sight of the Yankee’s pitcher releasing the ball triggered the sequential activation of different subsets of granule cells and Golgi cells in Bill Mazerowski’s cerebellum. After years of practice, the downstream motor circuits had learned to recognize exactly which subsets of neurons signaled the appropriate time to initiate his swing for success in hitting the ball, and the connections from that subset of neurons to the motor circuitry had been strengthened. The same mechanism also may be used for some aspects of perceptual timing, a possibility supported by the observation that the cerebellar cortex is activated during language tasks. The above model is consistent with lesion studies, which implicate the cerebellar cortex in timing. However, the cerebellar cortex contains seven different classes of neurons, and therefore a more detailed analysis is required to determine the contribution of each of class of neuron in this network to the computation of time. Our project undertakes this detailed analysis, using an approach that combines the power of molecular-genetics with more traditional behavioral and electrophysiological approaches of systems neuroscience. One straightforward approach we will use is simply to record from individual Golgi cells during a simple motor timing task to determine whether the pattern of Golgi cell activation does indeed encode temporal information about the stimulus that triggers the movement. In addition, we will capitalize on the recent development of molecular biological tools for precisely perturbing the function of specific classes of neurons within a circuit. We will use these tools to generate a line of transgenic mice in which the Golgi cells can be functionally removed from the cerebellar circuit, and we will examine the consequences of this manipulation for the coding of time in cerebellar neurons and for the ability to accurately time movements. We will compare the effects of functionally removing the Golgi cells with the effects of functionally removing other classes of neurons from the cerebellar circuit. This systematic dissection of the cerebellar circuit will significantly advance our understanding of the role of each class of neuron in cerebellar computation. In particular, we will gain insight about how the circuit architecture of the cerebellum supports the measurement of time with an accuracy that enables some of us to hit baseballs out of the park.

While breast and colon cancers still remain very difficult to treat if diagnosed in their advanced stages, they both are readily curable if detected and treated at early points in their evolution. This need to diagnose early if cure is to be attained therefore both highlights and justifies the use of routine mammograms and colonoscopies in individuals at risk. Interestingly, despite being at least as incurable as these two systemic cancers, such an approach has never been considered for gliomas, the most common type of primary brain tumor. Thus, although it is readily acknowledged by experts that these tumors are universally very difficult to cure once diagnosed, research efforts continue to be directed exclusively towards finding a cure for established tumors. I believe that the major reason for this lack of interest is that it is implicitly believed that a glioma’s prognosis is fixed at the onset of the disease. This naturally leads to a conclusion that there seems little point in early detection, since incurability starts at the time that the first glioma cell is formed. However, I believe that . To evaluate whether early detection represents a viable strategy, one first needs to establish the sequence of events that occur early during glioma development. This includes not only those events that occur at and subsequent to the point of detection (i.e., by MRI) but also those occurring before. Second, a firm grasp of the cellular and environmental influences on the process are needed to enable the investigator to develop potential preventative therapies. Such a potential therapy then needs to be tested at various points in the course of glioma evolution to address whether it is curative only if administered before a certain point is reached. My laboratory has been using an established model of neurocarcinogenesis which closely mirrors the clinical picture to address these issues. Our data suggests that gliomas arise from a common precursor lesion. More surprisingly, we found that pathologic changes are noted four to five weeks before MRI imaging abnormalities (which if one extrapolates in terms of the differences in life expectancy translates to over three years for humans) and that . Our preliminary results have therefore laid the foundation from which we can now start to address the heretofore unasked question of whether early treatment can make a difference for our patients. In our application, we present experiments that will help us address the first and second steps in the process. Thus, we propose to develop reagents that can help us better monitor glioma evolution from before the earliest cells are pathologically detected through MRI detection and beyond. Furthermore, we will examine whether a cytokine whose appearance closely correlates with MRI detection (osteopontin) plays a role in driving the process of glioma formation. Having taken care of glioma patients for over two decades, I have participated in or read about countless therapies that have been heralded as potential breakthroughs for this disease, only to watch them fail to significantly improve outcome. However, even my increasing frustration does not yet allow me to champion expending efforts and resources to take this strategy to the clinic before there is sufficient evidence that justifies moving in this direction. One only has to look at how much of an impact early diagnosis has made in breast and colon cancers in the last few years to realize however that early glioma detection is a question that we need urgently to address.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Stanford University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020103\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Brain organization and function have fundamental similarities across species of primates allowing us to learn a great deal about human brain function through the study of other primates. For example, we know that in both humans and monkeys, the medial temporal lobe brain region is essential for normal memory function. In humans, declarative memory (memory for facts and events) is typically assessed by asking people to remember highly relevant human-specific stimuli such as spoken or written words, stories, or common pictures. A common strategy used to study the neurobiology of memory in monkeys has been to train them to perform human-inspired memory tasks in which they are required to remember pictures or common objects. However, monkeys are not just little people in fur suits and the use of human-centric stimuli disregards the species-specific learning and memory problems monkeys have evolved to face in the wild. For example, many monkey species live in complex social groups involving dynamic supportive and antagonistic relationships. Moreover, it is widely thought that much of monkey mental energy is devoted to managing their social life' - 5. Millions of years of complex social life has produced primate brains that are especially well suited for perceiving, remembering, and acting on social information including social rank, kinship, and alliances within the troop. Despite this evidence. systematic tests of social memory in monkeys have been largely ignored in neuroscience research. is to develop new behavioral tasks that test monkey social cognition. The development of these more naturalistic tests will offer two fundamental advantages over the typical memory tests presently used with monkeys in neuroscience research. First, memory tests using highly relevant and easily learned social information will provide closer parallels to the experimental approaches typically used to test declarative memory in humans. Second, this approach will allow experimental study of the brain basis of social cognition in primates. While this is an area of great interest in human psychology, nonhuman primate models of social cognition are not well-established. The development of these novel cognitive tasks for monkeys is significant because it will allow powerful experimental study of the centrally important human capacities for social learning, memory, and cognition. Social groups of rhesus monkeys consist of a stable linear dominance hierarchy such that all female members of one matriline (i.e., a group of closely related females) outrank all the female members of a lower matriline6 -9 . A dominance hierarchy also exists between the animals within each matriline. Moreover, these dominance relationships are \"transitive' such that if monkey A is dominant to monkey B and monkey B is dominant to monkey C, then monkey A is always dominant to monkey C. In addition to the stable linear structure of social dominance, there are also nonlinear transient alliances and friendships between monkeys that form and dissolve over shorter time periods. Indeed, accurate memory for both long-term and transient social relationships is critical for social and reproductive success in monkeys. Thus a \"social stimulus set\" provides fertile ground for testing a wide range of complex forms of memory and cognition in monkeys. One form of complex cognition that is relevant to this social stimulus set is transitive inference. Transitive inference refers to the ability to flexibly manipulate knowledge of the relationships between items in a linear hierarchy (e.g., A>B>C>D>E). Previous studies have concluded that both monkeys 10-12 and rats 13-16 can solve tasks of transitive inference and that this function depends on the hippocampal region, part of the medial temporal lobe. However, these previous studies used non-naturalistic stimuli and artificially constructed hierarchies that took long periods of training for animals to learn. In contrast, an obvious stimulus set for a test of transitive inference in monkeys is the natural, and presumably easy to learn, social dominance hierarchy. Here we propose to develop such a test of social transitive inference for monkeys. We will teach animals a linear social dominance hierarchy using video clips of animals interacting in dominance situations. We will then determine if monkeys have learned the dominance hierarchy by asking them to indicate the relative dominance of two monkeys that were not previously shown together, thus assessing the ability of monkeys to apply transitive inference across the hierarchy. In the initial of our social transitive inference task, monkeys will be shown short videos of pairs of monkeys engaged in dominance interactions (e.g.. one monkey eating while another waits, one monkey displacing another, or one monkey threatening while the other one cowers). Monkeys will view films of the following dominance interactions: where \"+\" indicates the animal that wins the competition. These interactions correspond to the social dominance hierarchy: A>B>C>D>E>F. Immediately after each film, subject monkeys will be shown still pictures of the two animals in the film and will be rewarded for touching the `winner' (i.e., the \"boss'\") of the competition. During the subsequent of the task, we will test the monkey's memory of interactions by showing pictures of pairs of monkeys, but without a video showing one monkey being dominant to the other. Subject monkeys will be required to indicate which monkey of the pair is dominant. Most interesting will be critical probe tests in which monkeys will be challenged with images of monkeys B and D, whom they have never seen interact directly. Although B and D have never been seen together before, the transitive property of rhesus social dominance requires that B is dominant to D by virtue of their relationships to other monkeys in the hierarchy, A>B>C>D>E. Monkeys that can correctly determine this indirect relationship between monkey B and D must be applying transitive inference to do so. Based on data from field studies, we predict that monkeys will not only learn the initial dominance discriminations easily but that they will express transitive knowledge of this relationship during the test phase of the task. The development of this social transitive inference task has both immediate and long­term applications for neuroscience research. The immediate application is in experimental studies designed to define the contribution of particular medial temporal lobe brain areas to social transitive inference. Hampton's lab will define the role of different medial temporal lobe brain areas in transitive inference by examining the effects of selective brain lesions. Suzuki's lab will use the task to examine the patterns of transitive-inference-related brain activity seen in the structures of the medial temporal lobe using neuronal recording techniques. It will also be of great interest to develop parallel tasks for social memory in humans whose brain activity can be studied using non-invasive brain imaging techniques. This proposal also has long-term implications for the development of a whole new family of naturalistic tasks for the study of learning, memory, and cognition using social information in monkeys. This new family of naturalistic tasks will provide a powerful set of tools with which to explore the neurobiology of a wide range of higher cognitive functions in monkeys.  Reference List 1. M.

The financial system is a distributed self-organized control system whose function is to process information and set prices. Prices in turn determine allocations of resources. When this control system fails to set prices correctly the result can be large inefficiencies in economic production and major social dislocations and inequality. This was dramatically illustrated by the recent technology bubble in American stocks. During 1999 the price of NASDAQ technology stock index rose by roughly 100%, then in the following year dropped by 60%. A popular view is that prior to mid-2000 any competent person with a decent idea for an internet product could easily get venture capital and raise money in the stock market, but since then, even many very solid enterprises have foundered for lack of funding. Real estate prices in Silicon Valley skyrocketed and then plummeted. All this happened without any apparent new information about the technology industry that should reasonably have affected rational valuations. Rather, it seemed that it was driven by investor sentiment and the internal dynamics of the financial system. Even more harm occurred in the 1998 Asian crisis, when a default of Russian bonds triggered major reallocations by American hedge funds which nearly caused a major global financial crash and resulted in several year-long recession for many Asian economies. Despite the recurring nature of financial bubbles, there is still a widespread belief that markets are almost perfectly efficient. Kenneth Lay, until recently the head of Enron, put it well when he said \"I believe in God and Free Markets\". At a recent workshop at the Santa Fe Institute, the consensus view among the mainstream financial economists present was that \"markets are about 98% efficient\", even though there was no justification or consensus on the reasoning that word support such an estimate. Financial economists commonly think in terms of informational efficiency, i.e. the property that prices filly reflect available information. But this also has implications for allocative efficiency - if prices don't properly reflect information, then allocations must be wrong. Wild swings in prices suggest underlying inefficiencies. Either small informational inefficiencies are strongly amplified in their effect on prices (and hence allocations), or informational inefficiencies are much larger than is commonly believed. Winston Churchill once said that \"democracies are the worst form of government, except for all the others\". I believe a similar statement might apply to markets. In engineering, a heat engine that is 40% efficient is considered extremely good. The principles of heat engines are well understood, are under the complete control of their designers, and have been perfected over two centuries. Why should we suppose that market agents who satisfy none of these criteria and have the complexities and vagaries of human behavior, are so much more perfect than carefully designed heat engines? While markets are very useful, indeed essential, their design is still imperfect: Once we understand how they really work, we can do a lot to improve them. To do this we have to make models of markets in which optimality is not assumed , and so efficiency is not effectively assumed at the outset. In this proposal we do not intend to make better predictions about price bubbles. Rather, we propose to develop a new conceptual framework that explains some of the statistical regularities in markets and allows us to understand the broader implications of these statistical properties to problems such as risk planning and market instabilities. Some of the specific questions of interest are: o What determines how much prices fluctuate? In particular, how does this depend on other properties, such as the flow of orders? o What is the explanation for the highly non-normal distribution of short term price changes? o What does market liquidity depend on? That is, why is it that sometimes a given flucutation in demand produces a small change in price, and other times it produces a very large change in price? o Can we explain the distribution of wealth quantitatively based on simple statistical theories? o How do we measure the efficiency of a market? Can we say precisely how market A might be more or less efficient than market B? o Are some financial agent behaviors detrimental to society, and if so, is it possible to suppress them without inducing greater harm in other respects? Almost all financial models assume a strong decoupling from the economy. Production is taken to be given, and the focus is on the price adjustment process. This throws out the baby with the bath water when it comes to addressing questions of social welfare. Prices are important precisely because they affect production. The fact that there are feedbacks between production and price setting dramatically complicates the task of the financial system, a problem that is usually neglected. Even though we do not imagine we can make accurate quantitative models for the economy, we do intend to explore this question in a qualitative way, by coupling simple \"toy economies\" to our simulations of price setting agents. A line of recent work that is related to ours is behavioral finance. The practitioners of this discipline have incorporated information from psychology to argue that not all market participants are rational, have documented price inefficiencies, and have produced toy models that qualitatively illustrate how irrationality can affect markets. Our approach is complementary to this. We differ in several respects: o We use simulation extensively. o The style of theory is strongly influenced by physic, computer science, and biology. o We do not necessarily assume that any of the agents in our models are perfectly rational. o We place a strong emphasis on the effort to match statistical properties of financial data. The work proposed here represents a new style for economics. We are proposing a mixture of applications - while most of the focus is on finance, we also look at some broader economic problems, such as the distribution of wealth (for the reason that the style of modeling is similar). If this approach demonstrates success in these problem areas, then one might hope that it could be exported to others. Speaking as an outsider who has recently entered economics, I have been struck at how much the epistemology of economics differs from that of the physical sciences. This is partly a matter of language, and partly a matter of real differences in substance. Some of it is justified because the object of inquiry is so different, but some of it is not. One of the tangible benefits of this proposed work world be a reworking of economic theory, making the relationship to the theoretical Foundations in other fields more transparent. The connections to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and ecology are much bigger than the naive observer might think - it is only necessary to elucidate them. This is partly a matter of translation, but it is also a matter of doing new original work. Thus, we think that the proposed work has direct value for society because of its potential to improve social welfare, and as well as indirect value for its contribution to the broader goal of the unification of knowledge.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Santa Fe Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002068\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '449,914', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

However, anyone who has listened to fluent conversation in an unfamiliar language has encountered the basic problem of word-shape identification: What one experiences is a stream of babble lacking any of the readily identifiable words, phrases, or sentences that one perceives when listening to a familiar language. It is not at all clear where one word ends and the next begins, and no known word-shapes are available to help anchor one's lexical or syntactic analyses of the speech stream. For infants, whose experience of language must at first be of just such a stream of babble, development of word-shape segmentation and recognition skills is an absolute prerequisite to further language acquisition. If infants cannot break input utterances into constituent components and determine whether the resulting auditory objects are exemplars of particular linguistic types, it will be impossible for them to learn what individual components mean and how these parts fit together. The representational units (e.g., words) emerging from segmentation serve as the basis upon which infants develop syntactic and semantic knowledge. Therefore, understanding how a child cracks the continuous auditory code and comes to identify the individual units within it is fundamental to understanding first language development. Infants show sensitivity to the rhythmic characteristics of their native language at birth. This is because infants are exposed to this aspect of their native language , with the prenatal environment serving as a filter through which rhythmic properties of the speech signal can pass. Newborn infants are also able to distinguish languages that have the same rhythmic pattern as their native language from languages with distinct rhythmic patterns. However, they are unable to distinguish among languages with the same rhythmic pattern. But by five months of age, infants have enough experience with their native language to distinguish it from other languages with the same rhythmic pattern, indicating that they have become sensitive to the specific features that make their language unique. But how do infants begin to recognize individual words within the speech stream? Some research has examined which aspects of a language's rhythmic pattern cue word boundaries. This work has highlighted the importance of the overall shape of a word, particularly the quality of its initial sound segment, to an infant's ability to locate it within fluent speech. This describes a general bias that infants may develop based on exposure to the rhythmic properties of their native language. However, it does not address how infants use specific information within words to distinguish them from surrounding speech. Other research has examined the particular characteristics of words that infants can use to guide their segmentation. For example, specific cues within words appear to help, such as the different contexts in which variants of a given sound can occur and in which certain strings of sounds are allowed. However, both these forms of sound-specific sensitivity develop subsequent to the emergence of initial segmentation abilities. Recognition of isolated words occurs much earlier. For example, infants prefer to listen to their own names over another name by 4.5 months of age. But recognition of individual words has been pursued as a separate question from how infants begin to segment the speech stream. I have recently examined how infants' early recognition of over-familiarized words, such as their own names, may help them isolate words within fluent speech. Recent data from our lab shows that five-month-old infants can use their first name as a 'foot-in-the-door' for subsequent segmentation. Following familiarization with two segments of continuous speech, one containing several instances of an infant's own name followed by a word (e.g., ) and one containing several instances of another name followed by another word (e.g., ), infants prefer to listen to the word that followed their names (e.g., ) relative to the word that followed another name during familiarization (e.g., ). Apparently, infants' recognition of their own names helps them pull the word that follows it out of the speech stream as well. In a subsequent study, I found no difference between infants' looking times towards a word that followed another name during familiarization and a completely unfamiliar word not included in the familiarization stimuli. Not only did five-month-old infants prefer to listen to the word paired with their own names relative to the word paired with another name, but they were not able to parse the word that followed another name out of the speech stream. These findings indicate that infants' recognition of their names is a key tool they can use to break apart fluent speech early on in development. Most of what we know about infant language processing comes from infants' behavior in tasks like the ones I have just described. These methodologies exploit infants' tendency to look more or less towards auditory or visual objects, depending on whether these objects are familiar or not. This \"preferential looking\" is taken by researchers to indicate recognition. One problem with this approach is that infants sometimes prefer to attend to familiar stimuli and sometimes prefer to attend to novel stimuli. Yet and , as the two directions of preferential looking are called, are both considered valid indices of recognition. If an infant in an experiment prefers to listen to a previously familiarized word relative to an unfamiliar word, then the infant is said to recognize that word. Likewise, if an infant prefers to listen to an unfamiliar word relative to a familiarized word, then the infant is said to prefer the novel word because he or she recognizes the familiar word. Ultimately, it is the heightened looking time towards one or the other word that indicates recognition, regardless of the direction of that looking. Understandably, the lack of predictability in looking time direction is one aspect of this research that is often criticized. One approach to addressing this problem has been to analyze the characteristics of infants (e.g., age of the child) and stimuli (e.g., complexity of the task) across many studies to determine how the two factors systematically contribute to novelty and familiarity effects. Nonetheless, the problem remains that an infant's preference--conveyed behaviorally--is not an 'on-line' (or direct) measure of that infant's language processing capacity. In the adult language processing literature, on-line measures form the basis for theoretical interpretation. Multiple sources of on-line measures have become available for use with adults, from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to eye-tracking technology. These techniques have advanced the field of adult language processing. On the other hand, there has been no new on-line measure to advance our understanding of infants' behavioral responses to auditory stimuli. If the goal of the field is to develop models of language development, with constraints on developmental hypotheses provided by adult language processing research, and vice-versa, then we need to be using equally powerful measures. As it currently stands, we have very different types of measures. On-line measures of infant language processing like the work currently done with adults will help bridge the two areas. Unfortunately, methodological and ethical constraints have made it difficult to collect neurophysiological evidence of language processing from awake, behaving infants. Optical neuroimaging has emerged as a possible source of such on-line measures. Near InfarRed Spectroscopy (LAIRS) can provide \"functional images\" of an infant's brain by tracking changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the brain. This technology provides the first opportunity to follow the emergence of word recognition in infants and how it relates to an increase in hemoglobin concentration in specific brain regions. The benefit of LAIRS to the field of language development is two-fold: It can provide an important, advanced alternative to the off-line behavioral measures that are traditionally used, and it will allow us to look at localization of function as it applies to the emergence of infant word recognition. I propose a series of studies in which I will replicate the recent behavioral findings with first name recognition and segmentation (described earlier) in three different age groups (4-, 6-, and 8-month-olds) using optical imaging of infants' cerebral activation as the critical measure. The three hypotheses I am most interested in testing are: 1) Whether optical functional images of the frontal cortex of the infant brain will reveal blood volume and oxygenation increases consistent with emerging word recognition abilities, 2) Whether optical functional images of the frontal cortex of the infant brain will be distinct for semantic recognition (e.g., of one's own name) and episodic recognition (e.g., of a recently familiarized word), and 3) whether optical functional images of the infant brain will verify the neurological reality of familiarity and novelty effects in traditional looking time paradigms. This pilot work will help us understand how LAIRS can be used as a tool for studying the development of word recognition in infants, in particular, and infant cognition, in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Texas A&M University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020237\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '100,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

But what if our fireplaces and air conditioners meant that we could no longer grow Jersey tomatoes or even a few grassy lawns in the diminishingly green \"Garden\" state? Alternatively, what if our hour-long weekday commutes mean increased odds of weekend rain spoiling Sunday picnic plans? Recent findings suggest both of these scenarios are alarmingly likely for the U.S. East Coast population, but the scientific evidence needed to solidify those links continues to elude us (Cerveny and Balling, 1998). An important focus of the past two decades of climate research has been the predicted change in temperature trends globally, but these trends - while overwhelmingly supported by recent work - have failed to compel people to implement major behavioral changes in our society. The changes in lifestyle that may be necessitated in 100 years due to gradual and seemingly minor global mean temperature trends of tenths of a degree simply have not convinced us to change our behavior. After all, who would not want a few extra days each year of tank tops and sandals rather than ear muffs and galoshes? And while drastic changes are likely for some regions, key highly populated regions of the U.S. (such as most of the original 13 colonies) are predicted to undergo changes that on average (and aside from sea level issues in low-lying coastal regions) clearly do not amount to much more than that. Only recently have groundbreaking new data established the catastrophic implications of pollution on rainfall. Compelling evidence from satellite observations has provided a convincing link between dense pollution in southern India and recent droughts (Ramanathan et al., 2001). The implications for agriculture and other human activities are widespread, demanding behavioral adaptations ranging from food production to water usage. And more importantly, the climate impacts are linked in space and time to the emissions and their human sources. As a consequence, understanding the impact of human activities on rainfall reduction is not only a key missing component in the climate system but it is potentially a far more compelling way to close the cycle by allowing humans to react to climate change by providing real-time feedback on their actions that could result in policy and societal changes. Because of this tight link in time and space to human activities, understanding the science that controls the impacts of pollution on clouds is critical. In order to understand the impact of man-made emissions of black carbon and other pollution particles in perturbing clouds and interfering with the rainfall cycle, we must be able to accurately model the rainfall cycle of clouds. Why have we failed to either recognize or resolve this problem to date? The reason is that the human impacts on rainfall bridge two independently complex problems and require a truly interdisciplinary understanding that links spatial scales of nanometers to kilometers in describing physical processes with temporal events of microseconds to months in quantifying chemical reactions. The successful approach must build a multiscale theoretical model that faithfully represents measurements despite similar limitations in scale. My work and my research group bridge those traditional gaps between the disciplines of meteorology and aerosol chemistry, as well as the institutional gaps between measurements and modeling, in order to allow us to pursue a unique strategy in tackling this problem. I lead a research group of nine graduate students in studying some of the key processes that determine the links in these scales. Elizabeth Fetter studies the microphysics of clouds, Anita Adhitya models the radiative impact of pollution on clouds, Steve Maria measures the chemical components of clouds, and Monica Rivera identifies tracers of human activities in particle emissions. I have established strong collaborations on theoretical atmospheric models with Venkatachalam Ramaswamy and Leo Dormer at the premier geophysical modeling laboratory located at Princeton, and through this work I have combined our observational evidence with comprehensive models. I have designed, carried out, and interpreted ship- and aircraft-based measurements in eight major multinational field campaigns with leading observational experts. While we and others have made important strides in reducing uncertainties in a number of key problems, significant progress on understanding the role of pollution in clouds requires a unified modeling and measurement approach that does not fit in the current course of academic study or the current climate funding structure. The combined expertise along with my own 10 years of research in the field have lead me to favor a novel approach to predicting rainfall theoretically. The idea is to incorporate aerosol chemical evolution in a cloud-resolving model that can then be initialized to measured emissions. The predictions are compared to a time series of measurements collected by following an evolving cloud in a Lagrangian domain, so that the time history of the evolution can be used to directly evaluate the model processes. The project will start by developing the model for rainfall predictions along the US, eastern seaboard, where emissions are well characterized by government-sponsored projects. We will then use a research vessel and instrumented pod suspended from a ship-based helicopter to track the modeled cloud evolution northward and eastward. The current drought in this region has already begun to limit water usage and crop production, so the possibility that this reduced hydrological cycle is human induced has important ramifications for future behavior. In other words, it has been clear to date that reducing pollution emissions in the industrial and urban areas of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York has associated economic costs, but are those costs sufficiently high as to outweigh the water consumption needs of the millions that live here? The goal of this project is to put a price on that pollution by linking it to the reduction in rainfall it causes.  The significance of this approach is that it addresses the rainfall process at the microphysical (nanometer) scale to the cumulus cloud (kilometer) scale. The outcome provides a direct cause-and-effect link between pollution and rainfall in a politicallypowerful region. For historical, institutional, and political reasons, existing rainfall studies focus on global models that cannot accurately predict rainfall and weather models that do not account for the impacts of pollution. Conversely, current studies of pollution fail to provide mechanistic links to cloud formation and precipitation, so that the resulting gap in understanding will tend to persist unless a novel approach is taken. In order to make a significant step forward we will have to provide this link by a multiscale cloud model tied to well-constrained Lagrangian observations. References Cerveny, RS., and R.C.

Marvin Minsky, a founder of the field, has said that one major lesson is \"Easy things are hard.\" Computers have accomplished feats considered to be the pinnacles of intelligence, such as beating the world chess champion, solving complex symbolic equations, proving original theorems in logic, and diagnosing diseases. Nonetheless, computers still perform poorly on some of the most natural tasks for humans: navigating around a crowded room without bumping into anyone, speaking and understanding language, and recognizing faces and other objects in photographs and in day-to-day life. A general ability to perceive patterns and recognize similarities among them---i.e., make analogies---is at the heart of intelligence in natural adaptive systems, and is precisely what today's computers lack. Perception is a harder problem than chess-playing or equation-solving simply because it is so open-ended. Consider what goes into understanding, say, a photograph of a laughing girl on a swing in a playground, being pushed by two of her friends. The perceiver must determine, most basically, what are the relevant components of the scene---how the various lines, brightnesses colors, and textures fit together to make up the swing, the girl's mouth, or a patch of sand. Part of the swing set might be obscured from sight by a tree in the foreground; this must not interfere with its recognition. Abstract aspects of the scene must be recognized as well, such as \"girl,\" \"playground,\" \"friend,\" and \"having fun\". The perceiver must determine that the swing, the girl, and the laugh are important components of the scene whereas the specific orientations of each blade of grass or the specific yellow hue of the sand are not. The description of the perceptual process of even this simple photograph could go on and on, and attests to the open-ended nature of perception. Pattern-perception and analogy-making are not limited to humans or animals. Rather, they are continual modes of information processing in all intelligent systems in nature. The immune system, for example, perceives patterns related to the shapes of invaders, the sites and sizes of infections, the type and degree of cellular injury, and the similarity to previous infections in order to develop appropriate responses. Likewise, ant colonies recognize patterns of food distribution and of colony needs in order to develop foraging and task-allocation strategies. In these and other complex and adaptive systems, perception takes place via the collective actions and interactions of large numbers of relatively simple autonomous agents. My research focuses on developing computer programs that can perceive patterns and analogies, using inspiration from pattern perception in complex adaptive systems. This work explores some of the most fundamental questions of artificial intelligence. How does a person (or how might a computer program) mentally explore the typically intractably huge number of possible ways of understanding what is going on and possible similarities to other scenes or situations? How does the perceiver continue to explore new possibilities when the stimuli are continually changing? More generally, how can we build a computer program that achieves this fluidity of perception evident in natural systems and avoids the brittleness that plagues present-day computers? Douglas Hofstadter and I have developed a computer program called \"Copycat\" that addresses these questions. Copycat perceives patterns and makes analogies in the domain of letter strings, solving problems such as \"If abc changes to abd, what is the analogous change to kkjjii?\" In Copycat, the perception of objects, relationships, and analogies is carried out by a swarm of simple, relatively autonomous agents (analogous to individual ants in a colony or cells in the immune system) acting with no central control. The global perception of a scene or situation comes about as a result of many small, diverse, often redundant, and often fruitless explorations by these agents. This strategy allows the exploration of many different possible ways of understanding a situation to be carried out simultaneously, but at varying speeds and depths, which change continually as information is gathered about what is promising. Over time, a coherent perception is discovered and rival perceptual candidates fade out, though are never completely gone. This is similar to the way that exploration proceeds in the immune system, in ant colonies, and, we claim, in human cognition. Copycat was shown to give human-like answers to a large set of letter-string analogy problems, many of which required what people consider to be sophisticated pattern recognition and creativity. While Copycat's perceptual abilities were promising, they were limited to the domain of letter strings. It remains to be demonstrated that such a system will work well on more realistic situations requiring a much larger repertoire of concepts, or that these ideas will be useful for understanding information processing in natural complex systems. My current research is aimed at taking these two further steps. First, I am applying principles of pattern recognition gleaned from complex systems in nature to develop a computer program--a successor to Copycat--that can interpret and make analogies between visual images. Second, I am investigating the usefulness of such computational approaches for modeling pattern perception in natural complex systems such as the immune system. Understanding the contents of images in a general way is one of the most challenging problems facing artificial intelligence. One legend in AI has it that in the 1960s Marvin Minsky gave the problem of general image understanding to a graduate student as a short-term summer project. This was one way he learned the \"easy things are hard\" lesson. Forty years later, the state-of-the-art image understanding systems work well only in narrowly defined domains and tinder restricted conditions within those domains; they do not seem to be easily generalizable. What is needed is the kind of fluid pattern-perception and analogy making abilities seen in Copycat, but brought to a much more sophisticated level. In the 1960s Mikhail Bongard, a Russian computer scientist, developed a set of visual problems designed to capture the essence of pattern perception and analogy-making. Each problem presents the perceiver with 12 black-and-white line drawings, six on the left and six on the right. The task for the perceiver is to describe the difference between the left and right sets. For example, one Bongard problem consists of a left set containing only three sided shapes and a right set containing only four-sided shapes. Another problem, requiring more abstract perception, consists of a left set containing only horizontal shapes and a right set containing only vertical shapes. Bongard designed 100 such problems ranging from very simple and concrete to quite difficult and abstract. These problems capture many interesting and essential facets of visual pattern perception including those described above for the girl-in-swing photograph: perceiving concrete and abstract features and relationships, discovering which features and relationships are important and which can be ignored, separating figure from ground, hierarchically grouping features, and using context to guide the exploration of interpretations. My research will build on the ideas of Copycat by developing a computer program that solves Bongard problems. Success in this approach will set the stage for tackling such difficult real-world image interpretation problems, including handwriting recognition, remote sensing, image database search, and medical image-processing. All currently suffer from the fact that no one knows how to get computers to perceive patterns, incorporate context, and make analogies in general ways. I also hope eventually to extend these ideas to other perceptual domains, such as speech understanding by computer, which likewise will not reach human level without the kinds of high-level perceptual abilities required for Bongard problems. The ideas developed in this research may illuminate how information processing and pattern perception takes place in natural complex systems. Some researchers have described the immune system and other natural systems as \"cognitive\" in that they encode and process information, perceive patterns, make decisions, and learn from experience. However, the detailed processes by which these cognitive abilities come abort are still rat well understood. For example, immunologists Lee Segel and Irun Cohen have asked, \"How do systems choose the right set of agents to perform appropriate actions with appropriate intensities at appropriate times?\" This is the kind of question that my research attempts to address in the context of perception, and I believe the answers will apply broadly in complex systems studies. In general, computer models similar to the system I am proposing, which describe information processing in complex systems at a high level, might suggest concrete mechanisms as well as physical experiments to test for these mechanisms. High-level principles are much needed to help scientists make sense of the large amounts of data they encounter in studying complex systems in nature.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Oregon Health & Science University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002063\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '377,533', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Indeed, the association between Apollo and philosophy make it clear that for the ancient Greeks, self-awareness and self-reflection were essential for existence. This sentiment is best captured by another renowned Greek, Socrates, who famously asserted that, \"an unexamined life is not worth living.\"  This tradition was elaborated and extended by a number of leading philosophers of the Enlightenment, the most notable of which was Descartes (1637). Descartes' philosophy, like that of Socrates, highlighted the importance of both self-awareness and selfreflection to our understanding of being human. In fact, for Descartes knowing oneself and asserting, \"I think therefore, I am\" was the only way to prove one's existence.  The questions we hope to answer in the proposed experiments are in step with this centuries-old tradition of self-exploration. The unique contribution of this proposal will be to explore these same questions in a comparative framework where the differences and similarities between human and non-human primates will be systematically explored. The proposed experiments are of particular interest because Descartes and many others since have maintained that animals are unable to engage in the kind of self-reflection that led to the adage of \"I think, therefore, I am\" because animals lack the ability to communicate using language,  ", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Columbia University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020088\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '449,984', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

No man or machine can process this enormous amount of data and hence most of the knowledge is reinvented, duplicated across sciences, or simply lost forever after a short period of time. However, to survive as a species, we will need to preserve our planet or sustain life as we know it by other means. Besides achieving survival, we should aim to enable all human beings to live a healthy, productive, and fulfilling life. Meeting these challenges requires more efficient access to humanity's collective knowledge and tools that support the 'global brain' that is emerging on our planet.  This project is part of a larger initiative to chart and communicate the evolution of science on a global scale and to provide more effective means of accessing and managing humanity's scholarly knowledge and expertise. It aims to study science using the tools and methods of science as suggested by Derek J. de Solla Price more than 40 years ago. In particular, we propose to develop a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to model the structure and evolution of scholarly knowledge.  Recent work in network science aims to analyze and model the statistical and structural properties of paper-citation or co-author datasets. Of particular interest is the identification of elementary mechanisms that lead to the emergence of small-world and scale-free network structures. This project attempts to develop and validate agent-based, computational models that describe the dynamically evolving structure of scholarly knowledge ecologies. In particular, we are interested in analyzing and modeling the co-evolution of author and paper networks, the merging and splitting of existing scientific topics, the emergence of novel topics, the diffusion of reputations, and also the diffusion of scientific concepts via co-authorship and via the production and consumption of papers.  We propose to extend our previously developed TARL model of scholarly scientific growth (Börner, Maru and Goldstone, 2004). This computational model simulates individual scientists and their production and consumption of scholarly works. The original model assigned one topic selected from a fixed set of topics to each author and paper. However, one of the most important aspects of science is the spontaneous emergence of new scientific concepts. New topics and scientific disciplines might surface as existing topics differentiate into more refined specializations, e.g., HIV research as a part of immunology. Other topics, like nanotechnology, synthesize knowledge from different domains of science, such as engineering, chemistry, and physics. As science becomes more interdisciplinary, a single author will often possess knowledge in more than one topic area. Informed by these trajectories in the evolution of science, our extended model will simulate the specialization, unification, and shift of scientific concepts over time. Our elaborated representation of authors will include their geographic and topical position. More importantly, the location authors have in the coupled network of authors and papers will determine their access to high quality knowledge and expertise, their ability to collaborate with the best co-authors, their effectiveness in diffusing their knowledge, and ultimately their reputation. Rather than treating an author's knowledge as a set of independent and isolated concepts, the extended TARL model will represent authors' expertise by webs of interdependent concepts. Scientific communities, then, are social networks of conceptual networks. Scientific communication resembles the collective alignment and 'patchwork' of conceptual networks.  Empirical validation of the extended TARL model will use a database of about one million full-text papers covering two fields of science: physics (a 110-year Physical Review dataset) and computer/information science (using CiteSeer data). In addition, a 30-year Journal Citation Report dataset comprising Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index will be employed to validate the model at the level of journals. We will analyze and compare these empirical corpora and simulated data in terms of general statistics, local and global network properties, and general laws that describe the mechanisms of science.  Information visualization and cartographic techniques will be employed and further developed to visualize and communicate the diverse growth and interaction patterns of networks, as well as the diffusion of information over time, geographic space, and topic space. Domain experts will be consulted to validate data analysis results and to optimize visualizations.  The validated model is expected to formally reproduce and help analyze the dynamic characteristics of scholarly networks and knowledge diffusion. It will help answer questions such as: How will the structure of science evolve? How do authors and author communities use and contribute to the existing body of scholarly knowledge? How do scientific topics split and merge and how do new topics emerge? How does the reputation of authors and author teams diffuse? How do scientific concepts diffuse via co-authorship and paper-citation links? What is the influence of geospatial proximity and semantic proximity on the two above mentioned diffusion processes? What are the temporal dynamics of co-evolving author-paper networks?  The research is timely. Progress in applying the tools of science to understand science itself is facilitated by access to high-volume and high-quality data sets of scientific output, as well as computers and algorithms capable of handling this enormous stream of data. A deeper understanding of the basic principles of the evolution and diffusion of scholarly knowledge will facilitate the design and support of more effective research structures. The final outcome will be better support of knowledge production, access, and dissemination.  By modeling the evolution and diffusion of concepts in dynamically evolving network ecologies, the proposed research will advance methodological frontiers in agent-based modeling, cognitive science, complex network analysis, information dynamics, scientometrics, information diffusion theories, and information visualization. Findings of this project will have practical value for researchers and educators, research managers, grant agencies, and society, all of whom would benefit from a global view of the structure and evolution of science.  A workshop and summer school on 'Modeling Scholarly Knowledge' organized by the PIs in summer 2008 will bring together leading experts in this field, disseminate results of this project, and train interested researchers and students in using the developed models.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Indiana University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020085', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '420,164', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Among diffuse gliomas, oligodendrogliomas generally have a more favorable prognosis than astrocytic tumors. In addition, oligodendrogliomas remain the only subtype that commonly responds to chemotherapy, with approximately two-thirds of cases responding dramatically to PCV (procarbazine, CCNU and vincristine) treatment. The most widely used method of brain tumor classification is that of the World Health Organization (WHO). In the majority of cases, the WHO classification system provides a means for placing tumors into specific, relevant categories. However, although the classification of a glial tumor as an anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade III oligodendroglioma) can suggest an average clinical course for patients with these specific lesions, this classification alone can not predict the clinical behavior of an individual patient's tumor.  Advances in molecular genetics have aided in both the classification and clinical management of these tumors. In particular, allelic loss of chromosome 1p in anaplastic oligodendrogliomas has been demonstrated to be a powerful predictor of chemotherapeutic response to PCV treatment and combined losses of 1p and 19q predict longer survival in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Currently, however, 1p/19q testing is not readily available in all institutions. In addition, loss of 1p does not identify all tumors that respond to PCV treatment, emphasizing the need for additional, more practical markers of chemosensitivity in these tumors. Moreover, the molecular pathway(s) responsible for chemotherapeutic response in these lesions remains unknown. Characterizing these pathways will be significant in understanding the biology of treatment response in oligodendroglial tumors and could lay the foundation for the development of targeted molecular therapies for gliomas that are resistant to conventional therapies.  The advent of gene expression microarray technology has allowed us to monitor simultaneously the expression of thousands of genes in tumors. We have used this technology to define genes associated specifically with chemosensitive anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and with loss of chromosome 1p. Using these genes, we will develop immunohistochemical markers capable of identifying those anaplastic oligodendrogliomas most likely to respond to chemotherapy. In addition, by examining the expression level patterns of these genes across individual tumors, we will characterize the molecular pathway(s) activated/repressed in chemosensitive anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Finally, using these novel insights into key molecular pathways, we will investigate the phenotypic consequences of altering these pathways .  The proposed project could have a substantial impact in the field of neuro-oncology. Accurate immunohistochemical markers for chemosensitive oligodendrogliomas would be directly and immediately applicable to clinical practice, greatly aiding therapeutic decisions. Furthermore, the biological insights obtained from these investigations could lay the foundation for development of new, targeted molecular therapies, not only for anaplastic oligodendrogliomas but for glial tumors in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts General Hospital-Molecular Neuro-Oncology Laboratory', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020086\\n', 'year': '2005', 'amount': '300,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The options for treatment are limited. Sadly, many brain tumors are fatal. The most common brain tumors are the glioma and the meningioma. Scientists know a lot about gliomas, but not much about how meningiomas form. Meningiomas are slow growing tumors that are attached to the dura, a covering that surrounds the brain. These tumors are common in people in their sixties and seventies, particularly in women. Although most are benign cancers, meningiomas can grow into the brain, spread along the dural covering, and even metastasize to the lungs, liver and bone. Meningiomas often develop in people who have been exposed to radiation. Aggressive surgery is currently the best treatment. No chemotherapy has been proven effective. Since people who have the inherited cancer predisposition syndrome, neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2). frequently develop meningioma, scientists have focused their attention on whether the NF2 gene plays a role in meningioma formation. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently detected genetic alteration in meningiomas. The NF2 gene is a member of the Protein 4.1 family of membrane-associated proteins. Recently, our laboratory has identified two additional Protein 4.1 tumor suppressor genes, 4.1B and 4.1R, that are also inactivated in meningiomas. To find out how important the NF2 gene is in the formation of meningiomas, we used a specially designed virus to inactivate the NF2 gene in meningeal cells in the dural brain lining of mice. We found that when NF2 expression was lost, meningiomas formed. Our NF2 mouse model represents a significant advance as the first and only small animal meningioma model. However, the frequency of meningioma formation is low, and there are some serious limitations with the viral NF2 inactivation approach we used. If we could develop a better model, the entire community of meningioma researchers could move forward and answer questions that have challenged scientists for many years. Based on our encouraging initial discoveries, we have initiated an international collaborative research program to develop robust preclinical mouse models of meningioma. In this proposal, we have three specific objectives. First, we will employ several additional strategies to generate mice that develop meningioma at higher frequency. In these studies, we will generate two strains of genetically-engineered mice that can be used to inactivate certain tumor suppressor genes in meningeal cells. We will use these new mouse strains to inactivate the NF2 or 4.1B gene specifically in meningeal cells. This will allow us to develop mouse models for the two most common genetic abnormalities in human meningiomas. Second, we propose to generate mice in which combinations of genetic alterations will be introduced in meningeal cells in living animals. This will allow us to develop mouse models of high-grade malignant meningioma. Lastly, the ultimate goal of these studies is to generate mouse models of meningioma that are suitable for evaluating potential chemotherapies. In this regard, we will study benign and malignant mouse meningiomas using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). At Washington University, we have access to one of the finest imaging centers in the world. We will collaborate with our colleagues in the Universitys Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, which houses two dedicated state-of-the-art small animal MRI machines. If we are successful in accomplishing these ambitious goals, the genetically engineered mouse strains we create for benign and malignant meningiomas will afford usand scientists elsewhere who grapple with the same issuesthe unique opportunity to begin translational research studies. We will be able to evaluate the clinical behavior of these tumors in mice, identify additional meningioma therapeutic targets for future drug design, and evaluate potential meningioma therapies. The availability of these genetically engineered mice will greatly accelerate the development and assessment of potential therapies for this important brain cancer in humans.

Additionally, NF2 gene mutation is one of the most common causes of benign brain tumors. These facts alone suggest that the NF2 tumor suppressor is a powerful regulator of tumor cell proliferation yet the normal function of the NF2 tumor suppressor protein remains unknown. There are four main types of tumors that are caused by mutation in the NF2 gene, including schwannomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas. Any type of NF2 gene mutation (truncating or missense) results in the loss of the NF2 gene encoded tumor suppressor protein, known as either schwannomin or merlin. When tumors occur sporadically (in an individual who does not possess an inherited NF2 gene mutation), schwannomas always lack schwannomin, while various studies have shown that roughly 50% of meningiomas, 10% of ependymomas, and some astrocytomas lack schwannomin. Mutation in the NF2 gene therefore is not always causative for sporadic meningiomas, ependymomas and astrocytomas. However these tumor types are also prominent in the spectrum of tumors found in patients with inherited NF2 mutations demonstrating the global importance of the NF2 gene to tumor suppression. Interestingly, recent investigations have also demonstrated that a subset of malignant mesotheliomas are also caused by NF2 mutation. Familial NF2 is a debilitating disorder affecting one in 40,000 individuals worldwide. Individuals with NF2 develop multiple tumors of the nervous system requiring surgical intervention, and NF2 nearly always results in death. The hallmark feature of NF2 is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas and excision of these tumors is often associated with loss of hearing in both ears. Additionally, meningiomas (tumors of the brain lining) and other schwannoma types affecting the skin and spine are common. Ependymomas and astrocytomas occur less frequently in NF2 patients than do meningiomas. NF2 patients also frequently develop cataracts and other ocular abnormalities. Since 1995 the research conducted in our laboratory has been steadfastly focused on identifying the function of the NF2 tumor suppressor protein by using a variety of experimental methods designed to determine the identities of other proteins in the cell with which schwannomin interact. While the identity of the NF2 gene has been known since 1993, research on schwannomin function has only partly divulged its normal function. It is clear that schwannomin is a member of a class of proteins that stabilize the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton (a lattice-like structure to which other proteins are bound which when destabilized causes proliferative changes). Our past work has determined that one important cytoskeletal protein known as beta spectrin interacts with schwannomin and that this interaction is important for cytoskeletal organization. We have also demonstrated that schwannomin interacts with HRS, a protein involved in attenuating growth factor signaling, and are actively working on elucidating the functional significance of this interaction. Other laboratories have also made significant progress on the function of schwannomin. Briefly, schwannomin (or merlin) interacts with CD44, NHERF, paxillin, RhoGDI, and with three members of the ERM family of proteins to which schwannomin belongs as well. While each of these interactors suggest cellular pathways regulated by schwannomin, none of the pathways related to these interacting proteins has been verified as being altered in patient tumors. The NF2 pathway of pathogenesis remains unknown. We discovered a new schwannomin interacting protein called p110 that is a member of a complex of eight to ten proteins known as the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3). It is well documented that the initiation of protein synthesis in the cell requires the actions of eIF3. P110 is required for normal eIF3 function, but the role of p110 in this process is not well described. There is strong evidence linking p110 and cellular proliferation that hints at a possible role for p110 in tumorigenesis. P110 is overabundant in some tumor types (seminomas) and other eIF3 proteins are overabundant in tumors as well (eIF3-p48/Int-6 has been described as an oncoprotein associated with the malignant transformation of mouse mammary cells, and the gene encoding eIF3-p40 is often amplified in both breast and prostate tumors). Like p40, the abundance of p110 can also be abnormally elevated by gene amplification. In fact, the chromosomal region where p110 is encoded in the human genome is prone to duplication, and one study showed that the intact p110 gene was amplified in multiple tissue types associated with disease predisposition. It is our hypothesis that schwannomin has a critical function in specific tissues in regulating p110 activity. The identification of p110 as a schwannomin interacting protein provides a new and exciting avenue for analysis of schwannomin role in tumorigenesis. Our preliminary data demonstrate that schwannomin and p110 interact directly and colocalize in cultured cells similar to human cells that give rise to schwannomas. We have also obtained preliminary data suggesting that schwannomin can inhibit protein translation. We hypothesize that schwannomin is a regulator of protein translation through its interaction with p110, and the proposed work will thoroughly test this hypothesis. Successful demonstration that schwannomin inhibits protein translation by way of its interaction of p110 will provide new targets for therapy for NF2 and for a variety of brain tumors in general.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2004', 'amount': '300,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The remedies are not simple, but clearly marine reserves have a fundamental role to play. The design of reserve systems requires a sound theoretical foundation, which has led to the beginning of a science of reserve design, both in marine and terrestrial systems. Complexity in the design of marine reserves results from the large number of species involved and from the underlying physical and biological heterogeneity of the landscape. More precisely, coastal ecosystems consist in an ensemble of spatially subdivided communities, each composed of species that interact with each other as well as with the environment across temporal and spatial scales. This description of complex marine systems actually corresponds to the definition of a metacommunity. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive theory of coastal systems where few key abiotic and biotic factors drive the collective dynamics of large ensemble of interconnected communities. This effort will integrate the complexity of coastal ecosystems within a well-defined theoretical framework. It will also lead to predictions that can be validated using existing large ecological datasets and used as the basis for the development of optimal marine reserve networks in order to maintain biodiversity and stability of marine species. Ecological communities inhabiting rocky shores have served as the hallmark of ecological complexity. For example, the diversity of intertidal species along the West coast of the United States is in part maintained by waves disturbances affecting mussels attached to the substratum and allowing other less competitive species to colonize and persist. This succession of species observed after a disturbance typically involves many species and a very complex set of positive and negative interactions between them. Complexity is also present at larger scales. Marine invertebrate species often have a pelagic larval stage that up to several weeks. During that time, nearshore currents transport larvae over tens to hundreds of kilometers for many species. This process thus creates a complex set of interactions between communities exchanging larvae. However, most fundamental and applied theories of large-scale coastal systems addressing the dynamics of large ensembles of such communities still ignore the combined effect of this spatial interconnection and of species interaction. In other words, coastal ecosystems still lack any theoretical framework recognizing their intrinsic complexity. Rather current theories posit that large-scale variability is controlled by oceanographic heterogeneity at corresponding scales. The lack of agreement between current model predictions and observed regional patterns of species abundance and community structure in natural communities suggest that macroscopic properties of coastal systems are not simply obtained from accumulating our knowledge of local communities. It rather becomes important to explicitly understand complex networks of interactions, both between species, and across space if we expect to reach significant understanding and sound management of coastal ecosystems. Our approach thus consists in studying the emergence of complexity within and among communities from simple ecological processes that are known to regulate rocky intertidal communities. More precisely, the self-organization of species assemblages featuring positive interactions will be studied in a metacommunity where nearby populations can exchange larvae. These localized interactions have the potential to explain the formation and maintenance of heterogeneity in the distribution of species at scale much larger than those of underlying ecological processes. Because natural and managed coastal ecosystems are characterized by strong environmental heterogeneity (shoreline configurations, ocean currents, reserves), we will then determine how locallygenerated self-organized variability interact with environmental heterogeneity imposed at multiple scales to govern regional dynamics and community assembly. Marine ecology theories lack such level of integration and complex-system theories mostly consider selforganized (intrinsic) and environmental (extrinsic) causes of patterns as alternative hypotheses, thus rejecting their potential synergy. General and specific predictions will then be built to assess the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic causes alluded to above, and tested using data gathered over 6 year (ongoing program) from 29 intertidal communities along the West coast of the United States (PISCO). The robustness of these validated hypotheses will further be tested using the data obtained from 1975 to 1986 at more than 150 sites in the gulf of St. Lawrence (Quebec, Canada). The newly attained knowledge regarding the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability in marine community dynamics will be applied to the selection of optimal marine reserve networks. Marine reserve networks (no-catch zones) have been shown to increase community stability and promote biodiversity. However, the models currently used to create marine reserve networks typically simplify the complex dynamics of coastal systems by adopting static approaches where only the local ecological and economic value of sites is considered. Recent efforts integrating more dynamic processes such as larval dispersal largely ignore environmental heterogeneity and other important ecological processes such as species interactions. What is the potential implication of self-organized dynamics on the optimal selection of protected areas? How long would it likely take to detect the adverse consequences of failing to integrate intrinsic (self-organized) causes of large-scale heterogeneity into reserve design protocols? We will develop optimal marine reserve networks using optimization algorithms (i.e. simulated annealing) by minimizing cost (i.e. the number and size of reserves) and maximizing biodiversity, persistence and stability of populations and communities. This optimization scheme will be applied to model results and allow us to determine the location, number, size and distance between reserves in our networks. Once the optimal networks are determined, we will compare their performance to that of reserve design algorithms found in the literature. By treating natural communities as complex systems and explicitly modeling the local interactions of their component species with the environment, we will further the theory of community ecology and marine biology by ascertaining the nonlinear interplay between abiotic and biotic factors and its role for regional patterns and community assembly. Our prediction is that coastal marine systems can be approximated as metacommunities in which larvae are exchanged among components, and in which the persistence of one species depends on that of others. The implication of our research for marine conservation is important: if the focus of research and planning is restricted to the local scale, or to static measures of ecosystem health, ill-conceived management schemes can result. Only through an integrated, dynamic global perspective can scientists and managers achieve the goals of marine conservation.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'McGill University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020115\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '304,500', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The , meticulously kept and preserved for over four hundred years, are an unparalleled resource for understanding the ways in which infectious diseases invade and spread through populations in space and time. Yet this wealth of data and the vital patterns it contains remain largely opaque to theoretical biologists, because the handwritten Bills have never been converted into a digital form. Until now. The purpose of my proposal is to study and model the spread of infectious diseases over the last four centuries in London, one of the most important centers of modern human history. I am strongly motivated to do this, because recent research has shown that extraordinary discoveries can be made from much shorter and less detailed data series. Indeed, great strides have been made in our understanding of infectious disease dynamics through analysis of published records of cases and death covering less than 100 years (almost exclusively since 1900), and through mathematical and computational modeling that has attempted to explain many of these patterns. In particular, 20th century data have revealed that while many infectious diseases recur frequently, the time between epidemics (and their overall pattern) changes dramatically over long time scales. For example, in a given city the observed pattern of incidence of an infectious disease can display simple annual cycles for many years and then suddenly change to a cycle of two or more years, or to apparently irregular behaviour, and then return to an annual cycle. Some of my own work has shown that these complex transitions in the character of infectious disease dynamics result from changes in birth rates and changes in infection control strategies, and that these transitions can be predicted using mathematical models. The discoveries that have been made to date represent merely the tip of the iceberg in terms of what can be discovered from historical records of epidemics. In principle, exploring historical data is straightforward, but in practice a serious impediment is that many of the relevant sources are not easily accessible and exist only in unique archives (such as the Manuscripts Section of the Guildhall Library). The Guildhall’s record of deaths in London, classified by cause, and separately classified by the parish in which burial occurred, is the empirical foundation of my proposal. While annual counts of deaths in London have been studied extensively by historians, demog- raphers and epidemiologists, the complete weekly records have never been digitized and converted into a format suitable for analysis. Yet these weekly records can reveal the detailed temporal and spatial structure of all serious epidemics in the city over the centuries as London grew from a population of about 125,000 in 1592 to more than 7 million in the present day. There is extraordinary potential to make new and important discoveries through analysis of these data and through modeling the complex epidemiological dynamics that the data reveal. The first step will be to digitize the mortality records and create a spreadsheet suitable for epidemiological analysis. You might hope that digitization would be a straightforward task that we could let a computer accomplish on its own using optical character recognition software. But because most of London’s mortality records exist only in handwritten form, we have no choice but to enter each data point by hand. Epidemics of certain diseases are known to have occurred in London, and will form the starting point of my analysis. Major epidemics of occurred in London in 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636 and culminated with the “Great Plague of London” in 1665. Minor plague epidemics occurred in 15 other years during this period. I will begin by describing the spatial dynamics of these epidemics using standard statistical approaches and by creating movies that show spatial spread over a map of 17th century London. It will then be possible to address a variety of questions that could not be approached previ- ously, and which have important implications for modern day infectious threats (including plague itself, for which there is still a reservoir in rodents and which has the potential to explode in hu- mans again). For example, how did the transmission rate of plague change between 1592 and 1665, during which the population density of London increased four-fold? Are the observed spatial and temporal mortality patterns consistent with plague being spread from rats to fleas to humans? Or must direct human-to-human transmission (e.g., pneumonic plague or a different pathogen altogether) have been critical during times of major plague epidemics? These questions can be addressed using mathematical and computational modeling techniques. Such methods make it possible to discover which mechanisms give rise to which observed patterns. If we start with a simple model that can describe an epidemic, but the pattern of epidemic it predicts is not consistent with the data, then we can include more mechanisms in the model, step by step, isolating how each mechanism alters the patterns we would expect to observe. For example, when studying epidemics of plague in London, I will begin with a model that divides the whole population into a few compartments according to disease status (e.g., susceptible, infectious, recovered). Such a model can’t tell us anything about spatial spread, but it will allow us to estimate the transmissibility of plague in the city as a whole. I will then need to look at the effects of interactions among rats, fleas and humans. Next, spatial structure can be included in steps, for example by first considering the effects of the population being divided into two groups (within the walls of the city and outside the walls) and then considering the population broken down into the 130 parishes for which the Bills of Mortality provide weekly plague deaths. Finally, I will carry out computer simulations of transmission dynamics among the half million people living in London at the time (since we don’t have individual level data, these simulations will mainly test the robustness of simpler models). Another important disease about which we can learn a great deal from the weekly London mortality records is smallpox. London experienced periodic smallpox epidemics throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, with declining disease-induced death during the 19th century. While the 19th century reduction in smallpox mortality is thought to be related to control practices, especially vaccination, detailed modeling and comparison with the weekly records will allow me to estimate the role that vaccination played, and whether changes in virulence or transmissibility were likely involved. Influenza did not appear as a consistent cause of death in London’s mortality records until the 19th century, yet influenza viruses are believed to have circulated in human populations for more than 400 years. We know that major changes in human influenza, known as , occurred three times in the 20th century (1918, 1957 and 1968), but specific evidence for shifts before 1918 is very limited. With the detailed spatio-temporal record of mortality from all causes in London, and comparison of those data with expected patterns of mortality from newly invading influenza viruses, we have the potential to discover when previous shifts probably occurred. Such information is important not only for understanding the ecology and evolution of influenza in the past, but for predicting the likely frequency of influenza pandemics in the future. The development of the field of modeling infectious disease dynamics has been greatly influ- enced by a few time series of incidence of measles and other childhood diseases covering a few decades of the 20th century. The complex patterns in these data immediately presented deep puz- zles and have generated thousands of research papers. The mortality patterns that I propose to study in this project cover a time period that is much more extensive than anything that has been analyzed to date with this level of spatio-temporal detail. It is difficult to foretell the discoveries that will emerge from the newly digitized data — and the modeling and analyses that they will inspire — beyond the likelihood that they will be profound.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'McMaster University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020113\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The systems approach to medicine derives from a simple idea — the difference between normal and diseased cells lies in one or more disease-perturbed networks. The initial perturbation could be the result of disease-causing DNA mutations and/or disease-inducing environmental signals. The disease-perturbed networks alter the levels of proteins whose expression they control—and this leads to the symptoms of the disease. Some of these proteins are expressed only in the diseased organ (organ-specific) and perhaps 10-20% of these are secreted into the blood and hence constitute a molecular fingerprint whose protein concentrations report the status of the corresponding organ— healthy or diseased—and if diseased different levels of proteins will correlate with distinct diseases. Brain-specific transcripts can be identified by comparing the brain transcriptome (level of expression for all genes) against the transcriptomes of more than thirty different tissues. Transcripts encoding potentially secreted proteins may be determined by several different computational programs. Since the disease-perturbed networks initiate a disease such as cancer, altered blood protein levels will permit early disease diagnostics. Blood circulates through the body and contains organ-specific, secreted proteins from all tissues and, accordingly, the analysis of the levels or these proteins will permit one to survey health and disease in all organs. As we learn to read these protein fingerprints, blood will become a highly informative window into human health and disease, providing a basis for diagnosing all types of human disease. Two attributes of the brain make it a prime candidate for the use of brain-specific blood diagnostics. First, it is perhaps the most difficult human organ to biopsy, so tissue-based diagnoses are impractical. Second, it is protected by the blood brain barrier (BBB). At first glance, this fact would seem to be a significant impediment to identifying brainspecific blood-borne markers. When intact, the BBB blocks secretion of some – but not all – proteins secreted into the blood. However, the BBB also provides some unique advantages to us. Most brain proteins are sequestered from the blood when the BBB is intact, so there are not the same levels of background fluctuations in protein concentrations that are seen for blood-borne markers of cancers in other organs. Since the BBB becomes permeable under acute disease, the mere presence of a range of brainspecific proteins can signal acute disease that disrupts the BBB. In previous work, we have identified several brain-specific blood proteins that are potential diagnostic markers in the case of mouse prion disease (a neurological disorder). We believe we can do the same for brain cancers. The development of blood markers to detect, diagnose, and monitor therapies for gliomas are of utmost importance, and may be easily discoverable using the approach we used for prion disease. In addition to the medically important problem of identifying candidate markers for early diagnosis and the stratification of the various stages and subtypes of gliomas, we also believe that the brain-specific fingerprints will permit us to follow responses to treatments—either successful or unsuccessful. Moreover, we propose a new systems approach to move beyond the identification of markers for diagnosis to a more challenging and, in the long run, more important problem of utilizing blood measurements to track and identify the key perturbations in the biological networks that cause the disease. Developing the capability to identify network perturbations through blood measurements will open up a new avenue to drug target identification and will provide a novel means to discover the perturbed subnetworks, the further study of which is most likely to yield fundamental mechanistic insights into glioma pathology, and ultimately improved therapies. The goals of our project are to 1) identify candidate markers for early diagnosis, stratification of the types of gliomas, assessment of the stages of glioma progression and an assessment of responses to therapy, 2) develop a novel systems approach for identifying network perturbations in gliomas, and 3) discover a set of molecular fingerprints for specific perturbations to glioma cell lines. We will also be working with collaborators to test the candidate markers in the sera of patients. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will be prepared to use these markers in conjunction with our novel approach for identifying network perturbations from blood measurements in patients.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Institute for Systems Biology', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020108\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In 2005, twenty major armed conflicts were waged around the globe, with 40% of intrastate armed conflicts lasting for 10 years or more and 25% of wars lasting for more than 25 years (see Marshall & Gurr, 2005). Decades of research have contributed to our understanding of the many factors that can contribute to the intractability of conflict. In his meta-framework on intractable conflict, Coleman (2003) identified over fifty variables associated with the persistence of destructive conflicts. These include a variety of different dimensions of the contexts, issues, relationships, processes, and the outcomes of such conflicts. The multiplicity of factors makes each instance of intractable conflict unique, so perhaps it is not surprising that scholars have yet to articulate a coherent and testable theoretical model that links the component parts to underlying structures and basic dynamic properties. We propose that the approach of dynamical systems provides a comprehensive and heuristic theoretical foundation for analyzing and understanding intractable conflicts and that this foundation generates fresh insights into possible modes of conflict resolution (Coleman et al., in press). An explicit attempt to investigate the nature and resolution of intractable conflict in dynamical terms has not heretofore been undertaken. The outcome of the proposed research, then, may serve two important purposes. First, it may provide new and hopeful insight into the fundamental features of intractable conflict, a pervasive problem of societal and international significance. Second, the proposed research program may provide further evidence that dynamical systems can function as a unifying paradigm in social science, as it does in other areas of scientific inquiry. From a dynamical perspective, the escalation toward intractable conflict can be understood in terms of the inherent tendency toward self-organization among the elements comprising a complex system. In social systems, self-organization occurs when different attitudes, norms, values, symbols, and action tendencies tend to become interlinked by means of positive feedback loops and thus mutually reinforcing. The activation of a specific attitude, for example, may bring to mind a wide variety of norms and values that are consistent with the attitude. These selforganized ensembles function as attractors for the system, so that despite the potential for divergent information and contradictory external influences, the system’s behavior consistently converges on—is “attracted to”—the same pattern of thought, affect, and action. The development of attractors through the progressive self-organization of individual elements is responsible for the emergence of higher-order properties that enable integrative functioning and coordinated action of the system. Normally, however, positive feedback loops are balanced by negative feedback loops, a self-regulatory process that prevents a system from spiraling to an extreme state. The balance between positive and negative feedback loops is the essence of self-regulation. If a person acts aggressively toward someone, for example, his or her next thought or action is likely to be less aggressive, perhaps even conciliatory. Under positive feedback, however, the aggressive act would promote further aggression, leading to an escalating sequence of uninhibited aggression. The loss of negative feedback can be manifest at different levels of personal and social reality. With respect to individual dynamics, positive feedback among thoughts and feelings can produce global (undifferentiated) judgments, stereotypes, and intense affect, setting the stage for extreme action. With respect to social dynamics, positive feedback means that individuals reinforce rather than inhibit the extreme thoughts and actions of one another. Groupthink and deindividuation represent well-documented instances of the loss of balance between positive and negative feedback in groups. Coherent and extreme action can be the consequence of this breakdown in social self-regulation. In the dynamical framework, the loss of negative feedback is central to intractable conflict. From this perspective, there are two approaches to resolving intractable conflict. The first reflects the fact that a complex system is likely to have more than one attractor for its dynamics. The potential for multiple attractors in social systems suggests that conflicts do not necessarily show a spiral of escalation, but rather may be open to resolution, provided that one of the attractors is associated with thoughts and actions of a benign or positive nature. In such an attractor landscape, the resolution of conflict may appear suddenly and catastrophically, as thoughts and actions move from the basin of one (negative) attractor to the basin of another (benign or positive) attractor. Such an attractor may be latent rather than manifest under a set of conditions, however, and thus invisible to observers as well as the parties themselves. The challenge is to identify latent attractors that can transform the relations among the conflicting parties. The second approach is to disassemble a negative attractor and provide for reconfiguration of the system’s elements. This involves decoupling the thoughts, perceptions, issues, and action tendencies that have become linked through positive feedback. Once decoupled, the natural tendency toward self-organization might generate a qualitatively different attractor for the parties’ respective mental, affective, and behavioral dynamics regarding one another. The challenge in this case is how to recapture the complexity of thought and action that is lost when there is an imbalance between positive and negative feedback loops. Recent research in dynamical social psychology (Nowak & Vallacher, 1998) suggests means by which an attractor can be disassembled and reconfigured. To date, the basic features of the framework have been subjected to preliminary testing in computer simulations and have been used for training individuals professionally concerned with conflict resolution. These efforts need to be substantially expanded and validated with data from real and simulated conflicts. The transformation from such a framework to a fully developed theory requires an interdisciplinary approach designed to capture the structure and dynamics of conflict in different domains and to test and validate specific hypotheses with experimental data. Toward that end, the proposed research plan will be implemented by a multidisciplinary research team consisting of 1) a specialist in the study of intractable conflict (Peter T. Coleman); 2) two social psychologists with expertise in the application of dynamical systems to cognitive, interpersonal, group, and societal phenomena (Andrzej Nowak and Robin Vallacher); 2) a physicist with expertise in formal descriptions and the modeling of system dynamics (Larry Liebovitch); and 3) a social anthropologist (and practitioner) who specializes in international conflict and genocide prevention (Andrea Bartoli). The research team will communicate by electronic means and meet semi-annually over three years to synthesize insights from these diverse lines of research and practice to transform the preliminary framework into an integrative dynamical theory. The theoretical framework will be tested, validated, and revised from the results of the case studies, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations described in the Research Plan. The usefulness of the resultant theory will be continuously monitored and refined by frequent educational and training implementations for various groups of practitioners in the area of conflict resolution. Ultimately, the theory will be used for training individuals involved in conflict resolution and disseminated for broader educational purposes. This emergent dynamical theory, suitably validated and refined by experimental data, is anticipated to provide understanding of the progression of conflict that leads to intractability, enable analysis of existing intractable conflicts, and offer practical scenarios for the resolution of seemingly intractable conflicts. The theory will be written in the language of the social sciences, but the concepts will have counterparts in the mathematical descriptions of attractors from the physical sciences that are sufficiently precise to provide the basis for computer simulation testing of the model. This project will have a very broad impact and intellectual merit by providing a robust theoretical model validated through case studies, laboratory experiments, and computer simulations that has utility for scholars, policy-makers, and conflict-practitioners in preventing and addressing protracted social conflict. Too often, those people most affected by such conflicts, or best situated to address them, come to feel hopelessly overwhelmed by their complexity. Our work will provide a way to translate the insights and intuitions of stakeholders and conflict resolution practitioners into a theory that contributes to the reduction of human suffering worldwide. The broad range of ethnic, racial, and geographic diversity in the field case studies, and the investigators themselves, ensures the diversity of the project. The results of our project will be disseminated through published papers, conference presentations, educational offerings and educational curricula made widely available through the project’s website.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Columbia University Teachers College', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/220020112\\n', 'year': '2006', 'amount': '443,500', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

In some ways it resembles other complex systems, such as the weather. Speech, like the weather, is endlessly productive, providing no two examples of events which are exactly identical. At the same time, speech is structured, with some general types of outcomes being more common than others, both within languages and across languages. The existence of these preferred regions or states is known to be related to nonlinearities in the underlying physical system (including both the motor system which is part of human physiology, as well as the aerodynamics and acoustics, which characterize our natural surroundings). Nonlinearities are also implicated in the structures found in other complex systems. Lastly, speech displays structures at many different scales, from subparts of the syllable up through metrical structures, words, intonation phrases, and even stretches of discourse. For the weather, systematic effects can also be found at many different scales, from the eddies created by a tall building in the wind up through hurricanes and the jet stream. An important feature of the cognitive system underlying speech relates to the fact that a human mind can treat itself as both the agent of generalization, and as the object of generalization. The human mind, contemplating the external world, can form generalizations about it. In addition, it can treat its own mental states as data, and form higher abstractions about them. The ability to form and elaborate such higher level abstractions is a hallmark of human intelligence. It is perhaps related to consciousness, but it is not the same thing as consciousness. This is because the abstractions involved in speech production and speech perception are used with such speed and automaticity (due to the extremely practiced nature of the linguistic system) that the processing is unconscious. If linguists are able to establish that an abstract generalization exists, then they might speak of unconscious or implicit knowledge of that generalization. For example, implicit knowledge of word relationships is revealed by the ability to form neologisms such as contriten (to render contrite, on the pattern of tight/tighten) and to reject a neologism such as externalen (on the intended reading to render external). This project deals with implicit knowledge at three of the many levels of the human language system. These are the levels involved in the cognitive representation of the sound structure of language - phonetics through phonology. One level is an analogue map of the phonetic space, on which physical speech events are encoded in terms of their perceptually salient parameters. This level is analogue because quantitative similarity in all dimensions is relevant to the way it is used in speech processing. Then, the system also has a lexicon (or stored set of sound patterns of meaningful words; however the meanings themselves play a subordinate role in this study); it also has a phonological grammar, or general abstract characterization of the forms of words. One of the jobs of the grammar is supporting the productivity of the entire system. The grammar is compositional, determining the relative well-formedness of complex words from their subparts. When parsing neologisms, such as bnik or pranfletic, it will determine that bnik is not a possible word of English, but that pranfletic is. It adapts foreign borrowings into native form. It is also implicated in many other observable phenomena, such as speech errors, word games, and historical changes in sound patterns. The key to the productivity of the grammar is its compositionality. It evaluates complex forms in terms of their subparts. If the grammar just listed as acceptable all the real words, and nothing more, then it would never accept any new words. What are the subparts? Where do they come from? Why do they seem so similar from one language to another, when superficial phonetic details of languages differ in so many ways? This project seeks to address these questions by mathematical simulations of the grammar as an emergent system in the human mind. Contrary to a nativist approach, which presumes that the categories and structures of phonology are innate (that is, they emerged through evolution and are activated during language acquisition), the project explores the hypothesis that that the categories and structures of phonology are emergent in populations of humans in their lifetimes. This means that the innate human capability for language is more abstract than nativists would suggest, and that understanding the dynamics of the system can make a crucial contribution to understanding its near-stable state in the adult. Prior empirical results have provided crucial insights into how this emergence might occur. The minute phonetic details which characterize individual languages, the gradualness with which these details are acquired, and the gradience of historical changes in progress, all point to a system in which probability distributions are continuously updated through experience. The importance of type statistics (frequency counts over words), as against surface statistics (frequency counts on the speech stream) shows that probability distributions are implicitly maintained at both surface and abstract levels. The adult system permits the listener to recover the speaker's intent with extremely high accuracy. Almost all children learn to talk well, no matter which words of the ambient language they experience in which order. Grammars change slowly in comparison to the rate at which conversations take place; otherwise, communication would not succeed. In short, the phonology of any given language (as instantiated in the minds of youthful and adult speakers who are in communication with each other) exhibits notable properties of convergence, statistical robustness and near stability (metastability). Because these properties are found in only a few of the incredibly many dynamical systems which mathematics can provide, they are critical to the scientific characterization of human language. By developing and evaluating the behavior of schematic mufti?agent models, I hope to follow up these broad insights with specific explanations and predictions about some of the surprising and remarkable characteristics of human phonologies. The project will use existing speech and text databases for English and French, as well as on-line dictionaries. These languages are selected because they have notable differences in their phonetic inventories and prosodic structure. These databased will be mined for statistical regularities to be used in constructing schematic models of phonologies in multi-speaker groups. The general format of these models will integrate insights from prior work on phonetic categorization and on usage-based phonology. The exact behaviors of these models will be assessed by using the same databases for Monte Carlo simulations (in which random samples of varying sizes are used as speech samples which cause incremental updating in the listener). The results of these calculations will be used to make general deductions about phonology as a capability of humankind. Understanding the relationship between speech experience and phonological competence is important, because some humans do not acquire phonological competence at normal rates. Acquisition failure can impact their ability to speak or read. Normal speakers of one language often wish to learn a second language. For both of these populations, it is important to design educational programs which provide optimal experiences for developing robust and productive cognitive representations. The study of the emergence of phonology has further importance as a case study in the science of mind. Anyone who views the mind as embodied in the state of the brain is surely impressed by the ability of the brain to encapsulate general principles about the external world Black holes were predicted by Chandrasekhar from the equations of physics long before they were observed in the cosmos. A difficulty in creating a general theory of mind is that intelligence relates to our general understanding of the world - in short, to the whole theory of everything. Such a theory does not exist now, and it may never exist. However, in the case of phonology, the relevant physical world is limited, being the world of articulatory gestures, aerodynamics, and acoustics as used in speaking In the last 40 years, there has been immense progress on the scientific characterization of this micro-world. For many its aspects, exact equations are known, and heuristic assumptions about equations have permitted the construction of quite successful articulatory and perceptual models. As a result, phonology provides a microcosm in the which the relationship of the mind to the world can be explored in an exact, quantitative, fashion. The findings from this exploration will set precedents for examining the same relationship in other areas.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Northwestern University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002061\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '244,206', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Both of these techniques provide tools for understanding brain function, but both face limitations. The low temporal and spatial resolution of fMRI largely precludes the examination of quantitative mechanistic hypotheses. And to a single-unit electrode the sheer scale of the brain forces all studies to be about local, rather than global, processes. A very small group of laboratories have addressed these limitations by employing parallel electrophysiological and fMRI experiments. In these laboratories, fMRI provides global perspectives while single unit studies test quantitative hypotheses which emerge from the fMRI data at the cellular computational level. Unfortunately, none of these groups has begun to examine the neural architecture for decisionmaking. Over the past year a number of factors have led my group to conclude that our effort to understand decision-making has reached a point where a combined fMRI and single-unit approach is now required. Unfortunately, we lack expertise in fMRI. In principle, we could acquire expertise by collaborating with David Heeger's group at Stanford before building a stand-alone fMRI program in our laboratory at NYU. This would require that I, and one post-doc, spend significant time as apprentices with Heeger's group. Over the course of a 3-4 year period we would then gain sufficient expertise to independently undertake fMRI projects at NYU using the new Cognitive Neuroscience Center now under construction. The proposal that follows describes a four year project for studying decision-making using fMRI. The research would yield significant new results, but the real goal of the project would be to develop expertise with fMRI in my laboratory that would be adequate to ensure future government funding of research on these problems.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'New York University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002079\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '449,048', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Among the different types of cancer, brain tumors are not the most common. However, they are particularly frightening: they often affect children and young people, and they rapidly impair vital and mental functions, leading to death. Also, treatment of brain tumors offers few effective alternatives compared to other cancer types. Tumor formation is a multi-step process that reflects dynamic and complex changes occuring in the genome of a cell, where all the genes containing a complete set of inheritable information is stored. These changes in the genome result from mutations that progressively drive the transformation of normal cells into malignant derivatives. Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties: they divide in defiance of the normal control restraints and they invade and colonize the territory reserved for other cells. In spite of the complexity of cancer, there is an underlying principal in all cancer cells: uncontrolled, malignant growth. The accumulation of particular proteins, because they are over-expressed or because they are not normally degraded, is sufficient for cell transformation. Although these proteins are constituents of normal cells, they receive the name of proto-oncoproteins because of their transforming capacity when unregulated. One of these proto-oncoproteins is c-Fos. It has been postulated that c-Fos forms a complex with another proto-oncoprotein, c-Jun, and is imported into the nucleus where it binds to DNA and regulates the expression of target genes important for cell growth. We recently described that, in addition to its capacity to regulate the expression of target genes, c-Fos is capable of regulating the synthesis of a family of lipids called phospholipids (Bussolino et al. 2001, FASEB J. published online). These lipids are the quantitatively most important components of all cell membranes. Large scale biosynthesis of phospholipids is required for the generation of new membrane necessary for proliferation of tumor cells. To our knowledge, we identified the only protein - c-Fos - known up to date that is capable of activating the enzyme machinery responsible for phospholipid synthesis. We are directing our research efforts towards understanding how cells manage to create enough new membrane to support normal and exaggerated growth. In this project, we propose to examine the participation of c-Fos and other proto-oncoproteins in regulating phospholipid synthesis to support membrane genesis required for cell growth, in normal and transformed cells of the nervous system. It is expected that the comprehension of these cellular functions will enable researchers to intervene in these processes and control malignant cell growth. The specific aim of this proposal is to study the molecular mechanism by which c-Fos activates phospholipid synthesis to support growth in normal and transformed neural cells. For this, we will take advantage of the possibility of using normal and transformed cell lines in culture systems. These cell lines are homogenous populations of cells that have been immortalised. That is, they will proliferate indefinitely and their progeny will have the same characteristics as the mother cells. We have used neural cells in culture and have found that their growth rate strictly correlates with their content in c-Fos and with their synthesis of phospholipids: if c-Fos expression Is blocked once the nuclear program for growth and differentiation has been triggered, cells stop synthesizing phospholipids rapidly and growth goes to a halt. If, on the contrary, we increase cellular c-Fos content by specifically impairing its degradation, this protein accumulation stimulates the rats of synthesis of phospholipids. As a result, cells grow more and faster than those in which c-Fos is normally eliminated by degradation. At this stage of our research, we consider it very important to define precisely the molecular mechanism by which c-Fos stimulates phospholipid synthesis and consequently cell growth. Preliminary results to our lab indicate that in order to activate phospholipid biosynthesis, c-Fos interacts with other cellular proteins that catalyze the set of reactions responsible for the synthesis of these lipids. If we establish these interactions, then new strategies to curb the spread of cancer can be approached. For example, we can design drugs targeted to interfere with these interactions so that phospholipid synthesis is reduced, in an attempt to control the uncontrolled growth that is the hallmark of all forms of cancer. Such strategies aimed at restricting brain tumor formation while leaving other functions of Fos unaffected are very rare and very valuable. More importantly, they would bring hope to both physicians and patients.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'National University of Cordoba (Universidad Nacional de Córdoba)', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002065\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '300,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

What if nearly all children could survive this brain cancer, instead of the current 40 to 50%? These are the possibilities that represent extreme success emerging from a continuum initiated by the research I propose. How could this happen? We know that the cells of this tumor, medulloblastoma, can differentiate to become more mature brain cells, or neurons, in some children. When this occurs, those children face a more favorable prognosis. The notion underlying my proposal is that we can, in fact, induce the proliferating subset of medulloblastoma cells, the ones that grow and spread, to differentiate by manipulating the molecular machinery that controls differentiation. My present work is focused upon a family of genes called pp32, among other names. These molecules appear to act like senior executives in the cellular corporate world. Some molecules, transcription factors, have limited authority and work as middle managers might, at more restricted tasks and programs. pp32 participates in the cellular equivalent of broad strategic decisions. The decisions, \"Do I differentiate? Do I continue to proliferate?\", these broad programmatic and strategic decisions are the ones that pp32 participates in. It seems to participate in regulation of the histone code, a new term for describing how broad areas of the genome are selectively activated or made quiescent. It helps determine which classes of messenger RNA are stabilized for subsequent translation into proteins, and which are degraded. And, it helps determine whether cells live or die in a specialized cell death pathway. We have learned, empirically, that if we can manipulate pp32 at a crude level, using antisense technology, we can force cancer cells to differentiate into cells resembling neurons that no longer proliferate. And so, we dare to dream that we might, even at this level of understanding, be able to drive medulloblastoma cells into the same maturation. In our study, we will both learn more about the process, we will continue to define at a fine level of understanding exactly how pp32 acts, and we may, in fact be so fortunate as to benefit children with medulloblastoma. We may develop useful diagnostics to tell better who may survive, we may define groups that could benefit from differentiation therapy, and we could start on the road to developing the therapy itself.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': None, 'year': '2002', 'amount': '150,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

As Darwin articulated over 100 years ago, to address problems of evolutionary origins we must explore the design features of the trait in question, the extent to which they are shared with other species, and the selection pressures that led to the origins expression of the trait. Language evolution poses a problem on several levels. First, our direct ancestors are no longer around, and the fossil record is mute with respect to many interesting aspects of language including its neural architecture, the interface between computation and perception, and the role of peripheral organs in carrying inner thought to outward expression. Second, studies of nonhuman animal communication provide few strong cases of homology or analogy with language, thereby suggesting that the interesting evolutionary events occurred after the divergence point with our last common ancestor, some 5-6 million years, ago. Third, studies involving the use of signed or artificial languages by human-reared apes have met with mixed success, especially with respect to the infinite expressive power of human language; whereas apes can learn 400 or so symbols, this pales in relationship to the 60,000 words that a typical high school graduate knows. This claim is not meant to diminish what apes have learned about such symbolic systems, but rather, to point out that the mechanism underlying symbol acquisition and use is likely to be quite different. Fourth, many if not most researchers focusing on this problem have centered their efforts on the communicative aspects of language, as opposed to the computational and perceptual mechanisms that it relies on, and that may have evolved for reasons other than communication. The aim of this proposal is to explore to what extent human language relies on uniquely evolved specializations, focusing on three components: neurobiology, computation, and perception. Specifically, we ask whether each of these three components evolved uniquely for language, or whether they evolved for more general functions prior to the emergence of language. We argue that only comparative studies of humans and animals can address this problem. Why is the time ripe for such an approach? Over the past five years, my lab, in collaboration with linguists, cognitive psychologists, and neuroscientists, has developed new techniques that allow us to address these age old problems from a different perspective. Whereas dozens of studies have explored similarities and differences between humans and animals with respect to language processing, almost all have been based on techniques that involve extensive training. Our approach, in contrast, involves no training and directly parallels studies that have been conducted with human infants. As a result, we are not only capable of looking at the kinds of mechanisms that are spontaneously recruited, but in addition, can more directly compare the results obtained with human infants. Our research program has been designed to test the following hypothesis: . Consequently, the goal of research on language evolution is to uncover the computational mechanisms that animals lack, and the extent to which the constraints on language acquisition (over evolution and in development) rely on the emergence of new computational resources as well as their interface with non-language-specific mechanisms. This research program relies an three different techniques. Behaviorally, we implement habituation-discrimination methods that are the mainstay of studies of human language acquisition research; these techniques work beautifully with our target monkey species: tamarins and marmosets. Neurobiologically, we will explore the neural substrates involved during perceptual and computational tasks using fMRI with an awake monkey preparation. All of the tasks involve passive listening, and previous work with this technique has yielded highly reliable results with respect to passive olfactory discrimination. Lastly, we explore the role of experience by taking advantage of the breeding biology of our subjects: both species naturally give birth to twins (dizygotic). Our goal is to raise the twins in different auditory environments to understand how linguistic experience shapes perceptual distinctions. Theoretically, we use these three approaches to further explore the claim that perceptual mechanisms are shared across human and nonhuman primates, relying on general auditory mechanisms as opposed to mechanisms that evolved uniquely for speech perception. Similarly, we build on previous results suggesting that the kinds of statistical learning mechanisms that humans implement during language processing are highly limited in nonhuman primates, thereby revealing why animals have not evolved a system of communication like ours. Descartes famously proclaimed that our existence as individuals depends upon our ability to cogitate, reflect, and ponder. Language provides us with a medium for thinking about who we are, and for sharing our thoughts with others. When Gregor Samsa was transformed into a beetle in Kafka's , he certainly lost the expression of language, but neither his sense of self nor his internal language. By understanding how language evolved, we will illuminate one of the most fascinating historical passages of all, from a true beetle without a sense of self to a monkey or ape with a rich mental life, but little to no capacity to express it, to a human adult who can translate the inner language of the mind into an external expression, whether it is about a baseball score, a romantic moment, or the latest findings in science.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Harvard University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002076\\n', 'year': '2002', 'amount': '449,223', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Most of the objects are sculptures of mathematical shapes, which were created as teaching aids to help students understand complex geometry. One especially odd item is a copy of a famous bust of antiquity known as the \"Belvedere Apollo\". This version has pencil lines drawn across its surface, as though the head of Apollo had been deliberately defaced. Still more curiously, the lines were applied by students at the request of the famous mathematician Felix Klein. The lines mark particular geometric features of the curved surface-features that can be given precise definitions by mathematicians, in such a way that they could all agree on exactly where the lines should travel across the surface. The mathematical shapes at Göttingen are now old and the mathematics that they describe is firmly in the syllabus of university courses around the world. Nonetheless, in recent years, pictures of this defaced statue have been on display at research conferences where psychology and the study of the brain are discussed. What do scientists hope to learn from this? The link with the statue of Apollo arises because psychologists would like to understand how our eyes and brains help us to see objects in the natural world. One especially tough problem is how we see visual shape. Even a simple sketch with only a few black and white lines can be sufficient to give us a vivid impression of the shape of something. Artists practise their technique at length to get this just right. Newspapers have cartoons every day. How does so little convey so much? Felix Klein thought he might have the answer in a rather direct way from his mathematical geometry. He actually dared to think that he might discover the basic principals of aesthetic beauty simply by applying his mathematics. The \"Belvedere Apollo\" is a prime example of the ideal shape of classical beauty but judgements about aesthetics are highly individual and subjective. For Klein, the dilemma was to understand why so many people agree, when their individual judgements are subjective. The lines on the surface of Apollo, which follow the rules of geometry, might offer a solution. Perhaps, simply by getting the mathematics correct, the secret principals underlying classical beauty might be revealed. This now appears to have been desperately optimistic. Nonetheless, as so often in science, something rather useful emerges from the remains of a daring, if misconceived, idea. Psychologists and brain scientists have increasingly come to realise that, in order to understand why our brains work in particular ways, we must derive our understanding from the natural world. This is a central idea in biology, which we owe to Charles Darwin. Organisms (plants, animals, bacteria, and viruses) are constantly challenged by their environment. Those that are best suited to their environment survive and have offspring. The offspring face similar challenges, so over a sequence of generations the population changes. Eventually, it comes to consist of individuals that are better equipped biologically to live in their surrounding environment than those many generations ago. Thus, the environment shapes the individuals who must inhabit it. Darwin's insight was natural selection: the environment will select individuals through the mechanism of inheritance from one generation to the next. Nowadays, we also recognise that the environment has a profound influence throughout the lifetime of single individuals, through the mechanism of learning. Whether we are thinking about either genetic inheritance or learning, we need to understand our visual environment in order to understand shape perception. Here lies the connection with mathematics and Felix Klein. Since before the time of Euclid (some 2200 years ago), mathematicians have used their skill to describe the natural world. Indeed the word geometry derives from Ancient Greek and refers to \"measurement of the land\". If mathematicians have insight into the structure of the natural world through their understanding of geometry and shape, then psychologists and brain scientists need to understand their way of thinking. Obviously, not all of the mathematics will be relevant for understanding how we see. Furthermore, the steps from a mathematical description of shape to an understanding of the psychology of shape will be much more tortuous than Felix Klein supposed. The various intermediate steps need to take in brain science, optics, computer vision and robotics, neural networks and psychology. Hence, this involves gathering information from a wide and varied field. One of my aims with a 21st Century Fellowship is to write a book, which will evaluate how far we have got and attempt to achieve a consensus about what should happen next. Quite reasonably at this point, you may be feeling a little sceptical, perhaps even hostile. Possibly, we could put together an account of geometric shape in the natural world. Possibly also, we could use that account to understand how and why nerve cells inside the brain respond to visual information when our eyes are pointing in a particular direction as we look at an object. Conceivably, the geometry that we have discussed so far may be satisfactory for dealing with solid objects, such as statues, pebbles, tree-trunks, chairs, tables and so on. It is much less clear that the same geometry would be adequate for dealing with other objects that are of profound interest to us. Think about the changes in the human face during a conversation. The facial gestures are fluid and continuously changing. Think about flowers or leaves on a single plant, where the flowers and leaves grow to the same basic pattern but differ from one another, if we inspect in detail. Think about a flowing garment or stream of water. With all of these examples, we face a common paradox. We are acquainted precisely with the objects. We may conjure them up to our imaginations. Nevertheless, if we are asked for a detailed description in words, the description is always less than adequate until the reader has experienced the objects visually for themselves. Simply in order to discuss this alternative kind of shape, we need to give it a name and I propose here to refer to it as organic shape. To some degree, this label is no more than a statement of our ignorance. In another way, it captures an important aspect of these shapes. In all these cases, the shape is subject to a process that changes over time. It is not simply that the object moves around, whilst retaining its shape. The shape of the object is actually formed by a process that is extended in time. For example, flowers grow according to particular patterns that depend upon the species of plant. They often possess a degree of symmetry due to this process, although the symmetry is rarely exact because of variations in the rate of growth. It would be a major achievement to understand how we psychologically perceive objects such as this, which have developed according to a pattern. One approach is to carry out visual experiments in which people match up shapes that possess the same underlying pattern. To do this, they will have to identify visually the common elements that arise from the underlying pattern, rather like a botanist who is studying new species of plants. For convenience, computer graphics will be used to prepare and display the individual shapes. Like flowers, these artificially created shapes will differ in their individual appearance because the computer will superimpose random variation on the underlying pattern. The human observers will have to find the pattern and ignore the random variation. With modern brain-scanning techniques, we can also attempt to discover which areas of the brain are most active when humans are responding to these shapes. Does this mean that we should change the focus of Felix Klein's enquiry? Perhaps, the true nature of aesthetic judgement lies in the excitation of a particular state of the brain, rather than a mathematical description of ideal form. This proposal simply repeats the mistake in a new form. During their daily activity, people make judgements about the visual attractiveness of objects. Some of these objects are natural; others are human artefacts. Most people would feel that their evaluations are personal and unique, in a way that cannot be explained or probed by psychologists or brain scientists. Perhaps the most important lesson from Felix Klein's earlier attempt is to refine the question that science can legitimately ask. Whilst continuing to respect the personal element of aesthetic judgements, we can still ask what features of our brain and general psychology equip us with the ability to make judgements about shape and form. We can also enquire exactly how our experience of the structure of the natural world moulds our visual systems. This shared influence affects us all. Chaucer wrote, \"ful wys is he that kan hymselven knowe!\". As we become more \"wys\" about how our brains and bodies work, this increases rather than diminishes our appreciation of what it is to be human.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Oxford', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002072\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '366,518', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

We have healthcare, agriculture, communication and labor-saving devices that our forefathers could only dream about. It is humbling however, to realize that in spite of these sophisticated technological advances, a living cell remains more complex and efficient than any system designed by man. Implicit in this statement is the fact that if we understood the complexity of a living cell, we would be in a better position to harness biological systems for the economic, environmental and medicinal benefit of society. Research in my laboratory focuses on this goal by using a bacterial cell as a model of biological complexity. By removing individual components and assessing the effect of a specific change on function of the whole system we are uncovering rules that govern the complex interactions in a living cell. This approach is fundamentally distinct from one that utilizes experimental and theoretical predictions to generate model complex systems for analysis. The latter approach is limited to what is known or can be predicted. In contrast, dissecting an existing system, while it requires a long term investment, allows one to learn what is possible without bias generated by previous dogma. Diversity among life forms is a reflection of the breath of solutions that have evolved in response to problems faced by organisms in environments that undergo constant physical and chemical changes. Although it has long been accepted that visible differences are the result of biochemical diversity, it is now accepted that despite structural and functional differences, each living cell carries out a core set of biochemical reactions/processes that comprise its basic metabolism. The features unique to each organism are then integrated into the core metabolic properties. Effective coordination of these metabolic processes is essential for the function of each living cell. The realization that living systems are \"more similar than different\" in terms of metabolic strategies justifies our use of the relatively simple and technically amenable bacterial cell as a model system for biological complexity. My research is directed at understanding the rules that govern the integration of metabolism in a bacterial cell, and in the process designing theoretical approaches to complexity that will be applicable to other systems. A simple analogy I use to emphasize the significance of coordinating biochemical processes in a cell is that of a spider web. A spider is able to detect movement in a distant part of the web when a fly lands. This is possible because of links between threads that transmit movement in one area as a signal that can be detected anywhere on the web. I work with the assumption that disruption of a component in one metabolic process has consequences in many, if not all, remaining processes. Therefore, metabolic processes in a living cell must be integrated such that changes in one part of the network can be compensated for without compromising overall function of the system. Research in my lab is based on the premise that probing the integration of cellular processes will result in a profound understanding of the rules that govern a highly efficient complex system. The general strategy of my research has been to eliminate the ability of the complex system (in our case a bacterial cell) to compensate for perturbations. In doing so we ensure that disruption of one component will result in effects on function of the overall system that we can detect. This approach has allowed us to identify metabolic connections that would normally be masked by the inherent elasticity of the system. The design of our experiments is such that metabolic processes connected to a central point in the network are identified. In other words, we are identifying connections that radiate outward from a single fixed point. Continuation of this approach will result in a vision of the metabolic network in the cell where each point has its own radial network that is integrated with the whole. The use of sophisticated genetic analyses has been invaluable in my studies of the integration of bacterial metabolism. In theory a genetic approach removes components of a complex system (by mutation) and analyzes the resulting behavior (phenotype) of the system. From such an approach, one can make conclusions about how the system functions that are based on logical, deductive reasoning. When used rigorously this is an extremely powerful technique for dissecting complex systems in an unbiased way and is in many ways analogous to the deductive reasoning we all use to solve problems on a daily basis. The significant difference in our system is that we can remove components (i.e., make mutations) at will, allowing us to uncover interconnections in the bacterial cell. The continuing advances in molecular biology, sequencing and protein purification now make it feasible to extend these analyses to the molecular level. Thus, inferences from a global genetic approach can now be followed by modern biochemical and molecular techniques to define details of the metabolic interactions. The work in my laboratory is unique in its global goal of identifying pathway connections, and as a result expanding our knowledge of the complex interactions in a living cell. This is distinct from the work of many biological researchers who take a focused, reductionist approach to understanding a specific component within metabolism. Research of the global nature preformed in my laboratory will ultimately allow us to trace the movement of all metabolites through the maze of biochemical processes in a living system. Bacteria are clonal organisms, which means that the behavior of a population can be used to approximate that of an individual. This feature of bacteria make them well suited for addressing questions common to all life forms, such as the study of metabolism discussed here. Thus while a single bacterial cell is the relevant unit in this work, the actual experiments are preformed with populations of from 107 to 109 individual cells. The rapid generation time of bacteria allows us to obtain large populations (i.e., >109 individuals) in relatively short times (<12 hr). This property makes it possible to identify and manipulate the large numbers of rare events that are implied by the genetic approaches described above. Currently, using large populations is both feasible and informative, however, in the not too distant future a more sophisticated type of analyses will be required. At present, the generalization from population to individual behavior is sufficient since many features of biological systems have yet to be uncovered. At some point in the future, results of work like that carried out in my lab will have defined the majority of general parameters of metabolic interactions in the cell. At that time, techniques to eliminate the any remaining heterogeneity in the population will be required. We are confident that technology will be poised to solve this problem when it becomes necessary. Our engineering collaborators are in the final stages of designing micro devices that will allow us to analyze the behavior of <100 cells, as opposed to the current 109 cells. The potential of this micro-fluidics technology to further our understanding of the interactions occurring in a single cell is quite exciting.  It is hard to imagine a field of research that will be more critical in the future than that resulting in a better fundamental understanding of the living cell! The significance of understanding biological complexity in the 21st century is epitomized by the realization that nature is full of diverse systems that function with an efficiency man has never matched. Hidden in biological systems are the solutions to problems that technology will be asked to solve in the future. In the last seven years my laboratory has pioneered a novel approach to dissecting biological complexity with a bacterial model system. It is anticipated that data generated from this work will be used to derive computer programs with predictive value for other complex systems. Significant precedence exists for the use of bacterial systems to address problems of general importance. The ability to manipulate a bacterial system allows one to address problems of wide interest with a rapid, direct and detailed analysis. By understanding biological complexity society will be better prepared to derive solutions to various problems faced by society in the future.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Wisconsin - Madison', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002069\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

How do we determine the complex physiology of a living cell from the digital information (strings of A,C,T,G) encoded in its genome? In broad strokes, we know how this information is read out: genetic sequences are translated into polypeptide chains (strings of amino acids); these chains fold up into delicate three-dimensional structures (proteins) that carry out most of the jobs in a cell; proteins act not in isolation but in intricate networks of self-regulating functionality; from these functional subsystems arises the goal-directed behavior of the living cell. Each step in this read-out is a research area studied by hosts of experimentalists. Less evidently, each step entails challenging theoretical and computational problems, on whose solution future progress depends. For instance, no really reliable methods for predicting protein structure from sequence exist, and ab initio calculation of function from structure is still a primitive art. The most neglected aspect of the read-out problem is the \"last step,\" from complex networks of interacting proteins to the regulated behavior of intact cells. How are complex patterns of gene expression laid down during the first hours of development of a fruit fly embryo? How do epithelial cells know when to start and stop proliferation to close a wound? How does a bread mold anticipate the rising of the sun? How do yeast cells modulate their shape? In each of these cases, the behavior of the cell or tissue is intricately coordinated in time and space by an underlying molecular regulatory system, governed by physicochemical laws that are locally deterministic. In order to survive, compete, and reproduce in a hostile world, living organisms behave as if they possess \"clocks and maps,\" which must be created from such seemingly chaotic, disorganized, purposeless processes as chemical reactions, molecular diffusion, convective transport, and the like. For many years now, it has been known that large-scale spatiotemporal organization can arise spontaneously from sufficiently complex, nonlinear, reaction-diffusion-convection systems. The basic principles of biocomplexity theory were laid down in the \"heroic age\" (by Lotka, Volterra, Rashevsky, Turing, Hodgkin & Huxley, Prigogine, and others) and fruitfully applied to a wide variety of cell- and tissue-level problems in the 1960s and 70s (by Hess, Goldbeter, Segel, Winfree, Oster, Perelson, Goodwin, and others). In our opinion, the field of theoretical cell biology reached an impasse in the 1980s: the fundamental idea of order-from-chaos was firmly established, but the actual molecular machinery underlying most cellular responses were still shrouded in mystery. In principle, we knew how to derive the coordinated behavior of cells from underlying mechanisms, if only we knew what those mechanisms were. The situation changed dramatically in the 1980s, with the development of modern methods of molecular genetics. With these tools, experimentalists could dissect the molecular machinery of almost any physiological response in \"model\" organisms with well-characterized genetic systems. Indeed, this program was so successful that its practitioners, taking delight in each new piece of the puzzle, lost sight of the original goal of reconstructing the integrated behavior of intact cells and organisms from the underlying molecular components. Only recently have leading molecular biologists issued a call for theoretical and computational tools to carry out this reconstruction .   What these molecular biologists don't realize is that the tools they desire are already available, developed and refined by two generations of biocomplexity theorists. The greatest challenge of the next decade, in our opinion, is to demonstrate that the fundamental principles of spatiotemporal organization in nonlinear dynamical systems can be applied advantageously to the messy world of contemporary molecular biology. The goal of this next phase is to build realistic, comprehensive, accurate, predictive, computational models of the molecular machinery underlying fundamental cellular processes, such as cell growth and division, movement, interand intracellular signaling, cell suicide, embryonic development, etc. Models at this level of detail and complexity are new not only to molecular biologists, who are used to purely intuitive arguments about mechanisms, but also to mathematical biologists, who have favored simple, elegant, dynamical models unsullied by the messy realities of living organisms. In order to be taken seriously by molecular biologists, a new generation of theoreticians must come to terms with these realities. On the other hand, experimentalists must learn that computers will not solve all their problems, that to understand how cell physiology derives from molecular interactions they will need help from sophisticated techniques of nonlinear dynamics (bifurcation theory, pattern formation, robustness, distributed control, etc.).", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002050\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '448,034', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Most cultures use spoken languages, which appear in every corner of the globe in which people are able to hear and speak. These languages draw their sounds from a small set of the possible sounds we can produce, and then combine these sounds in sequence to form words, phrases, and sentences. In every culture there are words for a remarkably similar set of concrete and abstract concepts of objects and actions; and there is also a remarkably similar set of principles for combining these words to form the phrases and sentences of the language. For example, only a few of the many possible orderings of the words is actually found in languages of the world, and these few are common to many hundreds and thousands of the different and distinct languages. Human children are equally capable of learning any of the languages, and acquire their native language on a similar timetable, regardless of their culture or family circumstances. Perhaps even more surprising, when humans are not capable of hearing or speaking for example, when they are born deaf, when they grow up working in noisy environments (e.g., sawmills), or when their cultural rules involve long periods of life when speaking is prohibited (e.g., in certain Aboriginal cultures when a woman is widowed) - they readily develop sign languages, using their hands and eyes to express themselves in very comparable ways. Recent scientific findings have shown that sign languages which develop naturally among groups of deaf individuals have the same properties as naturally developed spoken languages. This is not because the signed languages borrow these properties from the surrounding spoken language. Sign languages that develop entirely independently of spoken languages have similar linguistic properties, even in remote regions where the users have never heard and never been taught to use speech or read print. The properties of human languages are not widespread across species; animal communication systems do not involve principles of order and combination of words or elements, and (despite some publicity to the contrary) animals reared in human families do not appear capable of readily acquiring a human language. In short, humans appear to have evolved special abilities for communication that are specific to our species and that are widespread across our members. An extremely important question, then, concerns what brain mechanisms have evolved in humans to permit and support these abilities. Previous research has shown that spoken languages are processed primarily by certain regions of the left hemisphere of the brain. These brain areas are larger in humans than in non-human primates, and lie at the intersection of the auditory and motor areas needed for processing and producing speech. Unfortunately, we have only limited understanding of the details of what these brain areas are doing during language processing, because most techniques for studying the brain are not possible to use on humans. However, modern techniques for observing brain activation in healthy human volunteers is helping to provide more information. One extremely important question is whether these left hemisphere brain areas are activated during the processing of sign languages, as they are during the processing of spoken languages. If the same brain regions subserve the processing of sign languages and spoken languages, as some of the limited available research indicates, it would suggest that brain areas initially specialized for the processing and production of speech may have evolved to control the processing of more abstract properties of language - its sequencing and its grammatical properties regardless of whether the language is spoken or signed. In contrast, differences in the brain regions activated for the processing of spoken and signed languages will provide important insights into the role of input and output channels in processing language, and may help us understand how these types of languages differ. The research in the present proposal therefore focuses on asking what regions of the brain are activated during the processing of various aspects of sign languages in deaf individuals who are native signers. We will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine which specific regions of the brain are active during specific tasks, as reflected by the level of oxygen in blood flow to these regions. If one compares a task involving processing a sign to one involving mere visual processing, it is possible to observe those brain regions specifically involved in understanding the sign. Similarly, comparing brain activation during processing a sentence in sign language to that during processing a random sequence of signs or of gestures can permit us to determine which brain regions are specifically involved in understanding the signed sentence. There are two reasons why studying brain activation during sign language processing will be especially revealing. First, looking for similarities in the brain regions involved in spoken and sign language processing will reveal those brain regions devoted to processing the abstract properties of all human languages. Second, in the visual-gestural medium we can compare the processing of sign language to the processing of a very similar but non-linguistic behavior: gesture. This second comparison we hope will permit us to gain insight into how the brain mechanisms underlying language might have evolved in humans. In the speech/auditory medium, there is no obvious elaborate use of sound from which spoken languages might have derived; our evolutionary early use of grunts or pre-linguistic sounds is apparently gone. It is therefore not possible to compare how the brain processes spoken languages to how it processes the non-linguistic precursors of speech. In contrast, however, in the visual-gestural medium, humans have both sign languages and the more widespread and simpler ability to 'gesture.' Hearing individuals gesture naturally while they speak, producing very simple gestures one at a time. When hearing people are asked to convey information entirely through gesture, without speaking, they are quickly capable of producing gestures in sequence in order to communicate. These gestural abilities are thought to be the source from which the much more systematic and complex properties of sign languages emerge, over generations, as deaf individuals begin to use these abilities for all of their communicative needs. We therefore intend to film hearing people producing these different forms of gesture, as well as filming deaf people producing sign language, and we will compare patterns of brain activation in hearing and deaf individuals as they attempt to comprehend these materials. Observing how the active brain regions change, as we move from simple through complex gesture and finally to sign language, can provide truly novel insight into how the brain may have modified its operations as language abilities evolved in humans. As noted, this research will have significant scientific benefits, providing researchers with new information about the brain mechanisms important for language processing, and how they may have become specialized and adapted for language. At the same time, our research has potentially profound benefits for the larger society and its health and welfare. Deafness affects millions of individuals in the world, including many children. The most devastating effect of deafness is, of course, on the ability to acquire and process language, as well as to acquire literacy. Our research is important for understanding the mechanisms by which deaf children and adults may be able to acquire natural sign languages, acquire sign languages devised as replacements for spoken languages in deaf education, or adapt to cochlear implants or other prosthetic devices providing access to spoken language. Our findings will therefore help to provide appropriate resources for supporting healthy development in deaf children and adults. Our proposed research will provide extremely important information about the adaptability and plasticity of the brain to perform human language processing through multiple channels and multiple media. Understanding the limits of such plasticity, and the flexibility and nature of the underlying brain mechanisms for language, can assist us in determining where our efforts in habilitative methods for deaf individuals should be directed. Such information will also be crucial for rehabilitating hearing individuals with congenital language disabilities, or with language impairments resulting from stroke or disease. Finally, an even broader import of our research is in its ability to reveal the deep universal properties of the human mind and brain, and its ability to perform in complex and characteristically human ways even when the sensory channels are profoundly limited and changed. Language is one of the peak achievements of the human mind. Only within the last 20 years have we learned that human language abilities flourish even within sign languages, and thus, are not restricted to speech. But because of limits on the scientific techniques available for observing the brain, we have not yet learned a great deal about how the brain actually performs this remarkable feat.

These are among the most lethal of cancers. For instance, breast cancer may strike 10 times as many people in a given year, but still there is an equivalent number of deaths from breast and brain tumors. Malignant gliomas make up the majority of primary brain tumors, and they are the most frequent solid tumor of childhood cancers. Recent evidence also suggests that these tumors are becoming increasingly prevalent among the elderly. Despite important advances in tumor detection and imaging, and in surgical techniques, treatment of most CNS tumors has been ineffective and the prognosis for these patients remains poor. Gliomas are particularly hard to treat because of their tendency to infiltrate into the folds and tracts of the brain. That is, they develop a central mass of tumor cells, but have many small extensions of tumor cells into the surrounding brain. Surgical procedures are of limited benefit for brain tumors as removal of a generous margin of tissue around the tumor mass is not possible in the brain, as opposed to solid tumors in other sites. In essence, the main part of the tumor can be taken out, but to get the infiltrative elements of the tumor, a large amount of healthy brain tissue would also have to be taken out. This, of course, is not possible, so the tumor ultimately continues to grow because all of it is not removed. Similar concerns limit the usefulness of radiation therapy as specific targeting of the infiltrative elements of tumors presents a significant challenge and the doses of radiation needed to kill tumor cells can also kill normal brain tissues. Chemotherapy can have an impact, but there is significant toxicity associated with its use, and the effects of this type of treatment on infiltrative tumor cells are also limited. At present, an appropriate balance between effective treatments and minimal deleterious effects on brain function can not easily be achieved. Recurrence of the tumor is generally within months and in some disease entities (e.g. glioblastoma multiforme) up to 80% of patients die within a year. While some treatments have shown promise for gliomas, the prognosis for patients with primary brain tumors has not improved significantly in decades. In practical terms, the next challenge can be simply stated. How can one target and eliminate the infiltrative elements of these tumors to improve therapy? Given the limitations of standard therapies, significant attention has been focused on development of alternative or complementary therapeutic approaches, such as activating the immune system. In the recent past, the CNS was often viewed as being isolated from the immune system, i.e. as being an immunologically privileged or inert site. Some experimental support exists for this view as it was observed that some immune-based therapies, otherwise effective in preventing the systemic recurrence of melanoma, failed to prevent their relapses in the CNS. In fact, several aspects of the CNS may influence immune reactivity in the brain including distinctive anatomic features such as the absence of conventional draining lymphatics and the presence of the blood-brain barrier. However, the immunologic privilege of the brain is far from absolute; and, there is clear evidence of immune responses established in the periphery which manifest in the CNS in autoimmune and tumor models. In truth, there is extensive evidence for the infiltration of gliomas by immune cells; and more importantly, there is evidence for localization of immune cells in the infiltrative elements of gliomas. This has resulted in substantial efforts to use the immune system to treat these tumors; and a number of reports are now available indicating that immunologic approaches to therapy can be of some benefit in the treatment of gliomas. Gliomas are infiltrated by immune cells such as lymphocytes, but still grow progressively and invasively. Therefore, it is apparent that the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are generally ineffective in mediating anti-tumor functions. There is ample data, including our own, analyzing immune cells sorted from gliomas indicating that their function is suppressed. However, given the recent advances in 1) the understanding of immune suppression and evasion by tumors; 2) use of biological response modifiers (BRMs) to activate lymphocytes in situ; 3) use of activated lymphocytes for adoptive cellular immunotherapy; and 4) development of vaccines for induction of specific anti-tumor immunity, it may prove possible to shift the balance in tumor-bearing individuals towards effective immunity to tumors. The main hypothesis underlying the proposal I have submitted is that the reversal of immunosuppression coupled with cytotoxic cell stimulation, RICS therapy, will have a therapeutic advantage over either approach as a single therapeutic modality. The approach we are taking combines the most recent and attractive results from various protocols aimed at inducing effective immune responses to gliomas. First, it is clear that gliomas produce transforming growth factor (3 TGFBeta), and this is responsible for much of the immune suppression associated with these tumors. Tumor cells make several forms of TGFBeta but they all bind to a similar receptor on lymphocytes, thereby inhibiting their function. It has recently been shown that blocking the production of TGFBeta by tumors, using an anti-sense oligonucleotide strategy, resulted in less tumor growth and improved immune responses to tumors. Phase I clinical trials based upon this approach are now in progress. However, this approach to blocking TGFBeta production requires that each cell be affected individually; and therefore a large percentage of tumor cells must express the anti-sense oligonucleotides to have significant efficacy. Unfortunately, current techniques for delivery of the anti-sense or its expression in tumor cells in situ only allow a very small percentage of cells to be affected. This will obviously limit the benefit of this technology. Fortunately, elimination of TGFBeta can be improved by making a simple shift in approach. That is, we propose to deliver a soluble receptor for TGFBeta to the tumor that will bind and inactivate this factor. This can be done by delivering a recombinant receptor via intravenous or intra-tumoral injection; or by tumors, and can also be given locally using gene therapy protocols. While this cytokine induces anti-tumor immunity, it is not highly effective as a single therapeutic agent, and large doses of this cytokine have significant toxicity for patients. Because there is promise associated both with elimination of immunosupressive factors made by tumors and with activation of immunity with cytokines, it seems obvious to hypothesize that combining these approaches will provide an improved response. Further, elimination of the immunosuppressive effects using the soluble receptor for TGFBeta will likely reduce the amount of 11,12 necessary to activate cytotoxic cells and thereby reduce or eliminate the toxicity associated with its use. It is my belief that there is great potential for combined approaches, and these will almost surely prove far more effective than any single therapy. In our initial period of developing these approaches, we will focus on combinations of therapy involving the immune system. As has been our approach in the past, we are starting with preclinical modeling with the goal of translating this approach into clinical practice as soon as possible. Being diagnosed as having a brain tumor can be devastating, and this disease evokes an emotional response in all of us unlike any other disease. Fortunately, through the combined strength of efforts of scientists, clinicians, patients, patient's families, and proactive people from all walks of life, there are exciting and promising approaches which may be translated into improvements in treatment, and hopefully into cures. I can only hope that the results of our work can contribute to some improvement in the treatment of brain tumors. One can not overstate the potential importance of improved therapy for these cancers.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Pittsburgh', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002041\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '449,262', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Classifying tumors based on large scale analyses of DNA or RNA is a promising approach for distinguishing similar appearing tumors. Aberrant methylation of CpG islands in DNA will be particularly useful in classifying tumors, since it plays an important role in inappropriate silencing of cancer genes in sporadic human tumors, including low grade brain tumors in which genetic alterations are far less frequent. Here we propose that the aberrant methylation is intimately associated with and contributes to the malignant behavior of brain tumor cells. A prediction based on this hypothesis is that gliomas of different malignancy grades may exhibit aberrant methylation patterns that are specific to a grade. The hypothesis also suggests that aberrant methylation might allow prediction of future behavior of tumor cells, prior to recurrence. We will test our hypothesis and predictions by determining the methylation status of 1184 CpG islands in low grade and high grade gliomas, using Restriction Landmark Genome Scanning (RLGS). RLGS is a method that separates radiolabeled NotI restriction in two dimensions, in a reproducible and quantitative fashion. As a prerequisite to tumor classification and prediction, we will first identify each of the 1184 genes corresponding to the anonymous CpG islands displayed on the RLGS profile, using our arrayed CpG island library. To classify the tumors, and to allow prediction of malignant progression based on methylation patterns, we will apply statistical methods and clustering techniques that are well suited for analysis of large data sets. Predicting progression at the time of the primary tumor diagnosis is critical to the appropriate application of aggressive therapy and to avoiding unwarranted toxicity.

It is widely believed that most complex systems are not amenable to mathematical, analytic descriptions and can only be explored by means of \"numerical experiments\". In the context of the mathematics of algorithmic complexity [1], many complex systems are said to be computationally irreducible, i.e. the only way to decide about their evolution is to actually let them evolve in time. Accordingly, the \"dynamical\" future time evolution of complex systems would be inherently unpredictable. This unpredictability does not prevent however the application of the scientific method for the prediction of novel phenomena as exemplified by many famous cases (prediction of the planet Neptune by Leverrier from calculations of perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, the prediction by Einstein of the deviation of light by the sun's gravitation field, the prediction of the helical structure of the DNA molecule by Watson and Crick based on earlier predictions by Pauling and Bragg, etc.). In contrast, it refers to the frustration to satisfy the quest for the knowledge of what tomorrow will be made of, often filled by the vision of prophets\" who have historically terrified or inspired the masses. The view that complex systems are unpredictable has recently been defended persuasively in concrete prediction applications, such as the socially important issue of earthquake prediction (see the contributions in [2]). In addition to the persistent failures at reaching a reliable earthquake predictive scheme, this view is rooted theoretically in the analogy between earthquakes and self-organized criticality [3]. In this \"fractal\" framework, there is no characteristic scale and the power law distribution of sizes reflects the fact that the large earthquakes are nothing but small earthquakes that did not stop. They are thus unpredictable because their nucleation is not different from that of the multitude of small earthquakes which obviously cannot be all predicted. Does this really hold for all features of complex systems? Take our personal life. We are not really interested in knowing in advance at what time we will go to a given store or drive to a highway. We are much more interested in forecasting the major bifurcations ahead of us, involving the few important things, like health, love and work that count for our happiness. Similarly, predicting the detailed evolution of complex systems has no real value and the fact that we are taught that it is out of reach from a fundamental point of view does not exclude the more interesting possibility to predict phases of evolutions of complex systems that really count. It turns out that most complex systems in natural and social sciences do exhibit rare and sudden transitions, that occur over time intervals that are short compared to the characteristic time scales of their posterior evolution. Such extreme events express more than anything else the underlying \"forces\" usually hidden by almost perfect balance and thus provide the potential for a better scientific understanding of complex systems. These crises have fundamental societal impacts and range fro large natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and tornadoes, landslides, avalanches, lightning strikes, meteorite/asteroid impacts, catastrophic events of environmental degradation, to the failure of engineering structures, crashes in the stock market, social unrest leading to large-scale strikes and upheaval, economic drawdowns on national and global scales, regional power blackouts, traffic gridlock, diseases and epidemics, etc. It is essential to realize that the long-term behavior of these complex systems is often controlled in large part by these rare catastrophic events: the universe was probably born during an extreme explosion (the \"big-bang\"); the nucleosynthesis of all important atomic elements constituting our matter results from the colossal explosion of supernovae; the largest earthquake in California repeating about once every two centuries accounts for a significant fraction of the total tectonic deformation; landscapes are more shaped by the \"millenium\" flood that moves large boulders rather than the action of all other eroding agents; the largest volcanic eruptions lead to major topographic changes as well as severe climatic disruptions; according to some contemporary views, evolution is probably characterized by phases of quasi-statis interrupted by episodic bursts of activity and destruction; financial crashes, which can destroy in an instant trillions of dollars, loom over and shape the psychological state of investors; political crises and revolutions shape the long-term geopolitical landscape; even our personal life is shaped on the long run by a few key decisions or happening. The outstanding scientific question is thus how such large-scale patterns of catastrophic nature might evolve from a series of interactions on the smallest and increasingly larger scales. In complex systems, it has been found that the organization of spatial and temporal correlations do not stem, in general, from a nucleation phase diffusing across the system. It results rather from a progressive and more global cooperative process occurring over the whole system by repetitive interactions. An instance would be the many occurrences of simultaneous scientific and technical discoveries signaling the global nature of the maturing process. Standard models and simulations of scenario of extreme events are subject to numerous sources of error, each of which may have a negative impact on the validity of the predictions [4]. Some of the uncertainties are under control in the modeling process; they usually involve trade-offs between a more faithful description and manageable calculations. Other sources of errors are beyond control as they are inherent in the modeling methodology of the specific disciplines. The two known strategies for modeling are both limited in this respect: analytical theoretical predictions are out of reach for most complex problems. Brute force numerical resolution of the equations (when they are known) or of scenarii is reliable in the \"center of the distribution\", i.e. in the regime far from the extremes where good statistics can be accumulated. Crises are extreme events that occur rarely, albeit with extraordinary impact, and are thus completely under-sampled and thus poorly constrained. Even the introduction of teraflop (or even pentaflops in the future) supercomputers does not change qualitatively this fundamental limitation. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that the progress of science and of its multidisciplinary enterprises make the time ripe for a full-fledge effort towards the prediction of complex systems. We propose to develop a set of novel approaches for modeling and predicting certain catastrophic events, or \"ruptures,\" that is, sudden transitions from a quiescent state to a crisis or catastrophic event. Such ruptures involve interactions between structures at many different scales. Our approach consists in combining ideas and tools from statistical physics and artificial/computational intelligence, to identify and classify possible universal structures that occur at different scales, and to develop application-specific methodologies to use these structures for prediction of the \"crises\" known to arise in each application of interest. We shall investigate the following concrete applications: (i) the hierarchical patterns and precursors that precede damage and rupture in complex heterogeneous materials, such as composites with multiple components and other elaborated engineering structures as well as earthquakes; (ii) the premonitory processes before financial crashes or \"bubble\" corrections in the stock market; and (iii) precursors to abrupt changes in climate and weather regimes. We will develop a new set of computational methods which are capable of searching and comparing patterns, simultaneously and iteratively, at multiple scales in hierarchical systems. We will use these patterns to improve the understanding of the dynamical state before and after ruptures and to enhance the statistical modeling of hierarchical systems with the goal of developing reliable forecasting skills for these large-scale ruptures. We live in a planet and society with intermittent dynamics rather than at equilibrium, and so there is a growing and urgent need to sensitize students to the importance and impacts of ruptures in their multiple forms. This research will thus have important implications for our graduate and undergraduate instructions at UCLA and in our outreach to a broader audience, that transcends a disciplinary community of scholars.

For the result of this is that one sees nothing, owing to the motion excited by the light still subsisting in our eyes. Also, when we have looked steadily for a long while at one colour, e.g. at white or green, that to which we next transfer our gaze appears to be of the same colour. Again if, after having looked at the sun or some other brilliant object, we close the eyes, then, if we watch carefully, it appears in a right line with the direction of vision (whatever this may be), at first in its own colour; then it changes to crimson, next to purple, until it becomes black and disappears. And also when persons turn away from looking at objects in motion, e.g. rivers, and especially those which flow very rapidly, they find that the visual stimulations still present themselves, for the things really at rest are then seen moving: persons become very deaf after hearing loud noises, and after smelling very strong odours their power of smelling is impaired; and similarly in other cases. These phenomena manifestly take place in the way above described. --ARISTOTLE, Parva Naturalia, Translated by J.I Beare (1908) in McKeon \"Basic Works of Aristotle\", Random House, 1941, p. 620-621 As Aristotle noted more than 2,300 years ago, our senses are not static. Most, if not all, of us have experienced and been fascinated by the \"waterfall illusion\" at one point or another. After watching a waterfall, \"things (e.g., trees) really at rest are then seen moving\". What was perceived a moment ago could have a profound effect on subsequent perceptual experience. These phenomena are now grouped under the name of \"sensory aftereffects\", or more specifically \"visual aftereffects\" if they are visual phenomena. These phenomena are indeed fun to experience, but understanding their neural basis can give us some clue to the age-old mystery of human consciousness. Visual aftereffects provide a dissociation between the physical reality and conscious experience. White appears as green after adapting to red, static objects appear to move after watching a waterfall. Somewhere in our brain, those little neurons are tricking us. If we understand how these perceptual experiences are generated (in the absence of corresponding physical stimuli), then we will be a significant step closer to understanding the neural basis of consciousness. Part of the problem is the lack of a concrete definition of consciousness, or even an understanding of exactly what consciousness is. But if we wait for philosophers to give us a clear definition of consciousness before starting our study, we may have to wait another 2000 years. The last decade has seen a tremendous growth of knowledge about the human brain. Many \"serious scientists\" have turned their attention to the question of \"consciousness\". Certainly, we do not expect to see the problem solved over night, but we are making small steps in the right direction. It is extremely difficult to understand how a process/object works, if we do not know what it is used for. Imagine someone trying to understand how a computer disk works without knowing that it is used for storing data. For this reason, in order to understand the mechanisms of human consciousness, we need to know what is it used for. In other words, what are the functions of consciousness? If we did not have consciousness, what would it be like? This question is the classical \"zombie\" question that philosophers have argued over and over. The problem is that we do not know where the \"consciousness switch\" is in a human, so we can not simply switch off consciousness and leave all the other cognitive functions intact. What we can do, however, is to create a controlled environment in which one can manipulate a specific aspect of a subject's conscious state, and observe the consequence of that manipulation. Visual aftereffects can be used as a test vehicle, because they are dynamic phenomena that afford the opportunity to study sequential events. Going back to Aristotle's observation of motion aftereffect, what if he were completely engulfed in a deep thought while looking at the river, so much so that he did not even know which way the river flowed-would he still experience the motion aftereffect later, that \"the things really at rest are then seen moving\"? We have a partial answer to this question. The motion aftereffect can indeed survive the absence of visual awareness', but the magnitude of the aftereffect is reduced. However, there are many other similar questions that remain to be answered. Only when we have a full picture of the effect of visual awareness on various cognitive functions will we be in a solid position to discuss the neural basis of visual awareness. A related approach to study the neural basis of awareness is to test the correlation between neural activity and awareness. Granted, correlation does not mean causation, but knowing the correlation will give us pointers to potential casual factors. Besides, neural activities uncorrelated with an observer's conscious experience could be ruled out as direct basis of consciousness. Under this premise, studies have been carried out to identify associations and dissociations between neural activity and conscious experience. We mentioned that visual aftereffects provided a case where perceptual experience is not directly associated with the stimulus, thus one can study the correlation between neural activity and \"perceptual experience\" in the pure sense, independent of the stimulus. Another case of dissociation between stimulus and visual experience is the case of stimuli that lie beyond the limit of resolution. For example, there is a clear boundary between resolvable and unresolvable stimuli: you can see the flicker of a light modulated at 30 Hz, but not at 60 Hz. At 60 Hz, the light is physically changing, but we do not experience the fluctuation. What are the corresponding neural states for these two conscious states? This question was very difficult to answer in human observers just 10 years ago, because there was not an easy way to look inside the brain to see what it is doing. However, functional brain imaging technology now allows us to \"see\" the activity inside our brain. Now if a subject is presented with a 60 Hz and a stable light, she/he can not tell the difference between them and is oblivious to the alternation between these two conditions, what if one area in the subject's brain shows different activity corresponding to these two conditions? \"Ah-ha\", you say, \"this brain area is holding back, is not telling the observer what 'it' knows\". The observer is not aware of the difference even though many neurons in this observer's brain clearly know that these two conditions are different. One simplistic conclusion is that these neurons are not the observer's \"conscious neurons\"; in other words, activity in these neurons does not directly support the observer's conscious experience. in the context of visual perception, the term \"visual awareness\" is used instead of consciousness. We plan to study the effects of visual awareness on various types of perceptual and cognitive functions, aiming at a better understanding of the functional role of consciousness or visual awareness. We also seek to delineate the neural bottlenecks in spatial and temporal visual resolution. At the end of this project, we want to be able to identify what visual processes can not go on normally without awareness; and what are the critical stages where spatial and temporal information is still represented but not available to consciousness. To philosophers, results from this project will give a more concrete answer to the \"zombie\" question. It may very well be that the \"zombie\" will forever stay a hypothetical entity, because our prediction is that it is impossible to have completely intact perceptual and cognitive functions without awareness.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Minnesota', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002026\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '445,319', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

However, there is little uniformity in childrens' experiences in these preschools. Some of these preschools provide only baby sitting. At the other extreme some of the most highly funded tend to push down the learning objectives of elementary school to younger ages. Although much of this situation involves societal factors that could not be influenced by our research, it is also true that psychological studies have generally argued that learning can only be effective within specific domains such as number or language. This view has the effect of adding scientific support for organizing preschools like elementary schools. However, we think recent scientific studies have suggested that 2-4 year old children are influenced by the development of attentional systems that provide the basis for their regulation of emotion and cognition. There is reason to believe that appropriate training of this system might have favorable consequence for later school performance in whatever domainis being taught. In addition, training might also help prepare the child for more general aspects of the elementary school environment such as the need to quietly maintain concentration for relatively long periods of time. It is possible that such training could also influence on the performance of children who would later be classified as having a learning disability or attentional deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Certainly if would be better to use training methods rather than drugs to assist children to use their attention in better ways. The current data on the development of attention systems largely rests on studies of adult patients with specific brain injuries and effort to image the brains of adults while performing cognitive tasks. The studies have shown several attention networks that have the function of maintaining alertness, orienting to sensory events and self regulation of emotion and thought. These networks appear to have a distinct anatomy, but clearly they also communicate with each other and many tasks that we perform involve all three networks. Recently, it has been possible to learn some facts about the development of these networks in infants and young children. The data have largely come from tasks that are known to activate these networks in adults and can then be studied in children at varying ages. For example, we have found that the ability to focus attention on sensory event undergoes a strong development in the first year of life. This development allows infant to focus attention on salient visual stimuli and also allows caregivers to use novel objects to capture attention and produce temporary calming of a distressed infant. It is possible for caregivers to teach infants at this age where to look to find a salient object and later to learn the name of the object. These developments involve specific neural maturation of brain systems or their connections. When adults are given tasks in which they are required to attend to one of several conflicting messages, particular brain areas become active. This anatomy involves activity in the midline of the frontal lobe in a brain area called the anterior cingulate as well as some areas closely connected with it. A somewhat separate cingulate area appears to be involved when the task involves emotional conflict. Currently some researchers believe that the cingulate and associated areas form an executive attention network that is in involved in both cognitive and emotional self regulation. When children of two to four years are placed in a task where they must ignore a response close to the stimulus and instead choose one that matches the stimulus but is at a very different location, they show strong conflict between choosing on the basis of location and of identity. Between two and four years they learn to control the strong tendency to choose based on location. Performance in this task is related to parental reports of effortful control or how well their children are able to control their attention and to inhibit undesirable behaviors in a wide range of situation. We believe this development depends upon changes that take place in the connectivity between this frontal midline area and other brain areas. Research suggests that the degree to which children develop effortful control influences their development of empathy and of conscience. In addition, effortful control appears to be a central component of the acquisition of high level skills such as reading. The absence of successful mechanisms of effortful control may lead to pathologies such as attention deficit disorder. Indeed it has been shown that children with this disorder have deficits in their ability to select stimuli and responses in the face of competition, and that adults who had attention deficit disorder as children, unlike other adults, fail to activate the cingulate region during the execution of conflict tasks. Our research proposes to train children of two to four to improve their effortful control. To do this we will use training exercises that have been developed to train monkeys and chimpanzees to respond to a given stimulus in the face of conflicting information from other stimuli. In work with non-human primates these tasks have proven very popular and appear to lead to a general decrease in aggressiveness and improvement in social interaction in their daily environment. Of course we cannot give the toddlers the same intense level of training that has been used with primates, but we have developed very sensitive assays that can allow us to trace any improvement that the training produces in any of the attentional networks. In addition, through imaging of brain electrical activity, we can examine changes in brain circuitry that might occur as a result of the training. This work should lead to improved scientific understanding of the brain areas involved in this form of attentional regulation. We therefore also plan to provide high levels of training a group of non-human primates. It is has already been demonstrated that the animals seek out the training and seem to like to choose which task to practice. It is possible, therefore to run thousands of trials over many months of practice. The natural behavior of these primates will be observed using instruments very similar to those used to study the toddlers. If this work is successful, we would be in a position to suggest a rational basis for development of preschool curricula. Preschool might be seen as a time when systematic effort would be given to the development of the skills of attention needed to succeed in all aspects of the elementary school curriculum. Although our studies would mainly be focused on individual attention by training with computerized exercises, we also believe it would be possible to build exercises that emphasized the importance of attention within the social situation of the school. By designing such group exercises that involve the class as a whole, the preschool child might also be better prepared to deal with the social environment involved in schooling.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Oregon - Sackler Institute', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002075\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

However, we are not born with such a well-fitted machine and its specialization is the result of the interplay of both internal specifications and environmental exposure. This selective specialization is clearly observed in language acquisition and use. Indeed, from zero to twelve months infants go through a period where they are just able to recognize some broad (rhythmic) characteristics of the maternal language, to having isolated some words from the continuous speech signal and given a meaning to these acoustic patterns. This acquisition of knowledge of the maternal language is accompanied by the loss of certain capacities present at birth. As adults we are extremely efficient at processing our maternal language, and quite poor at processing foreign languages. As the well-known example of difficulties by native Japanese speakers to perceive the English /r/-/l/ contrast shows, even simple phoneme discrimination tasks can be very difficult to perform in a foreign language. However, all newborn infants, Japanese too, are able to correctly perceive that contrast. In the past twenty years, researchers working in very early language acquisition have done important discoveries in the way this specialization process takes place. However, almost nothing is known of how bilingual infants learn their two languages [the term \"bilingual\" will refer to individuals who are exposed to two languages from the very first day of their lives, and any other type of \"bilingual\" exposure will be considered as \"L2 acquisition\"]. Bilingual infants receive a language input that differs from the monolingual one in some important aspects. One aspect is that of the amount of exposure: although the global exposure maybe the same, the input for each language is roughly half of that of the monolingual infant. The other aspect is that the input is \"noisier\", since in many occasions the infant gets one language mixed with the other one. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect some differences in the way bilinguals represent their two languages (as compared with monolinguals). What are the long-term and short-term consequences of this different exposure? Parents rising children in bilingual environments usually ask if it is good or it is bad to do so. Cognitive developmental neuroscience can provide no answer to this question. We know very little both about how bilingual infants acquire their two languages and how adult bilinguals process and represent their two languages in the brain (with very few exceptions, almost all psycholinguistic and brain imaging studies -as well as bilingual aphasia cases- refer to L2 learners). If the way the brain establishes many neuronal connections is done on the basis of the incoming stimulation (by selecting those connections more frequently used), it is highly possible that bilinguals have a different pattern of connections in the language areas of the brain, when compared with monolinguals. Daily experience shows no particular difficulty in adult bilinguals when using any of their two languages, but it could be the case that they use different procedures (or make use of compensatory strategies) that make the differences unnoticeable, unless specific laboratory tools are employed. For many years, bilingualism has been considered an atypical situation, restricted to the case of immigrants or to a situation confined to a few countries in the world. The current multilingual situation, both in the US and in Europe has put this issue in the front page. Studying bilinguals is learning how an increasing number of human beings acquire language. The goal of the present project is to gather deeper knowledge of how bilingual infants learn their two languages and, by doing so, we also hope to be able to better understand the mechanisms of brain and language acquisition. We plan to carry out a research program that will explore how bilingual infants raised in two different bilingual environments acquire their two languages. One potentially important remark is that not all pairs of languages are equally similar. As adults, we find some languages easier to be learnt than others. For instance, for a native Dutch speaker, learning English is relatively easier than learning Japanese. Although the learning situation is completely different for infants, it could be the case that also for them learning two similar languages implies different mechanisms than learning two different languages. Indeed, past research has shown that newborns can notice differences between some pairs of languages, but not between others. In fact, even five-month-olds cannot discriminate some languages (Dutch and German) if they are not their maternal one. The first thing a bilingual infant has to do to learn the two languages of her environment is to notice that there are two languages and not just one. Obviously, being able to notice the existence of two languages at birth or after a few months makes a quite different stating point. The first months of life is a period characterized by intense brain reorganization. As we said, before the end of the first year of life infants have already learnt a few words of their maternal language. In this context, a difference of a few weeks or months in making the distinction between the two languages of the environment may have crucial consequences in later brain development. Up to this point we have been considering language as if it was a unitary entity. Language is a complex system and learning it implies the acquisition of its sound patterns (the phonology of the language), the morphology and its syntax and semantics. These different parts of the language system are learnt at different moments and they impose restrictions on each other. In this project we plan to study how bilingual infants acquire and represent in the brain these different subtypes of linguistic knowledge We also intend to analyze the long-term consequences of being raised in a bilingual environment (for each of these linguistic domains) by studying adult bilinguals. One problem that many studies on bilingualism encounter is that of a proper comparison across populations and materials. Indeed, in many studies different languages are compared or individuals from different cultural backgrounds are contrasted. Quite often, if differences between two groups are found, they can be due to some language specific properties or to differences in the participants' cultural background. Furthermore, to successfully carry out an extensive project on bilingual infant language acquisition requires having access to a large and cooperative bilingual population. Thus, a lot of constraints exist in terms of properties of the languages being tested and of the populations under study for a project like the one proposed here. Spain presents a perfect natural setting to address these issues. There is a single common official language (Spanish) and in different parts of the country, other languages are also spoken (and they are co-official with Spanish). One of the co-official languages is Catalan (spoken in Catalonia by approximately 6 million people). Catalan, as well as Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French, is a Romance language. In the same way as Italian and Spanish are quite similar, Catalan and Spanish share many characteristics. Another co-official language is Basque (spoken in the Basque Country by approximately x million people). Basque is a non-Indoeuropean language, thus it is very different from all Germanic and Romance languages. Spanish, Catalan and Basque share the same social status and they are present in the media and at all levels of the educational system. Summarizing, monolingual Spanish, bilingual Catalan-Spanish and bilingual Basque-Spanish share a common language and a common cultural background [Catalan and Basque are also spoken in some areas of France]. These circumstances eliminate most of the methodological problems that other studies could have. By studying these two cases of bilingualism we hope to be able to cover two extreme comparisons in the language similarity-dissimilarity continuum. Therefore, the results of the present project should be generalizable to other bilingual situations and language comparisons. Finally, the results of the present research may serve as a basis for future advice in educational matters. Not only more precise answers concerning the implications of an exposure in early language acquisition could be given, but also some of the consequences of a bilingual situation for children with learning difficulties might be identified.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Barcelona', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002079\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '437,755', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

For example, until recently, a single numerical forecast was obtained by solving the atmospheric partial differential equations, providing forecasters with a deterministic solution. However, due to the effect discovered by Lorenz, the reliability of the forecast deteriorates exponentially fast in time, and this occurs at different rates in different places. This makes it difficult to tell when and for how long the forecasts are reliable. One simple method to gain insights to this problem is to use ensembles of forecasts. That is, several forecasts are performed every day, replacing the classical single \"deterministic\" forecast. The different forecasts are started from carefully chosen perturbed initial conditions and then remain similar for some time before they begin to give different results. This gives an indication of how long the forecast is reliable. For example if we create an ensemble of forecasts for 10 days, but we find that they separate within 3 days, then we can say that we have confidence in our forecasts only for up to 3 days. This also gives a measure of the complexity in the forecast. Such techniques have been used in the past on fairly simple systems where applications of chaos theory are now well developed. However, weather forecasting involves many more variables which leads to important theoretical and practical problems. We believe that addressing these problems will yield substantially improved forecasts. What can complexity and chaos do for weather prediction now? C. Leith, one of the pioneers in ensemble weather prediction illustrated the predictability problem in an American Geophysical Union lecture (Nov. 1999): \"It is not just butterflies; even talking about the weather will change the weather outcome\", but he added, \"Fortunately, talking about climate will not produce climate change\". In fact, there is increasing evidence that the atmosphere is not as chaotic as it was initially believed to be. A numerical forecast involves solving for several million variables that change with time (e.g., temperature, pressure, velocity, humidity at a large number of grid points). In contrast, ensemble forecasts of perhaps 20 solutions are computed by taking small perturbations of a \"primary\" solution and following these new perturbed solutions in time. Whenever they deviate too far from the primary solution, they are renormalized and reinitialized by being brought closer to the primary solution. These solutions result in what are called the \"local bred vectors\" or \"LBVs\". The LBVs represent the naturally occuring perturbations that are most unstable. For example, when modeling the Northern Hemisphere, we find that 20 ensemble solutions typically yield about 10 geographically isolated LBVs. Thus we can say that the space spanned by the unstable perturbations is of dimension 10 (not thousands, or millions, as the number of variables in the models). If the system was extremely chaotic, as previously believed, then we would expect to find many more unstable directions. Of course, these numbers have been obtained using only 20 ensemble solutions while in theory there are an infinite possibility of acceptable perturbations. If we used all possible perturbations to find the total number of LBVs then we would completely describe what we will loosely call \"the local surface\". This is the set of solutions that have diverged most rapidly from the primary solution and yet are still close to the primary solution. We propose to develop new techniques to isolate and study the time evolution of this space (the local surface) which we believe is responsible for the breakdown of forecasts. Our preliminary work indicates that it is, in fact, possible to isolate the LBVs in space and in time. Together all of the LBVs determine the local surface which is crucial for increasing the length of forecasts. By understanding properties of the local space, we believe that major improvements can be made to forecasting at all scales. For example, if we know characteristics of the LBVs, it should be possible to \"target\" only a few key high quality observations (i.e., flying a plane out to a location to make observations) in such regions to remove major errors in the forecasts. The time is now at hand for a multidisciplinary project like the one we have proposed, and given our dependence on advance knowledge of the weather, it is essential to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which forecasts breakdown. We believe that the research we propose has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of forecasts.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Maryland', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002044\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Universities want to build on it. Businesses want to manage it. Politicians and religious leaders want to embrace it. Despite its prominence, more than two thirds of American college campuses require a diversity course, and consulting firms with expertise in diversity training abound, diversity is not well understood. There is little formal theory of diversity. The goal of my research is to develop such a theory by constructing Foundational models of diverse, complex systems. This effort belongs to the larger agenda to develop complex systems' theory. Complex systems models are typically agent-based. The agents, who could be amoeba or nations, satisfy four criteria: (i) they are diverse, (ii) they are adaptive (iii) they interact locally and, (iv) they exist in dynamic environments. Complex systems exhibit perpetual novelty, they generate emergent behavior at the macro level that might not have been predicted from their micro Foundations, and they are often robust. The science of complex systems attempts to explain these and other phenomena. I focus on diversity for three reasons: its prominence, the abundance of data, and its scientific interest. Diversity awareness is high because America is becoming more diverse while simultaneously the world is becoming more interconnected. These two facts drive the movement toward the aforementioned diversity courses. In these courses, students learn about identity diversity and its implications for how people interpret their worlds. But identity diversity differs from economic, biological, and ideological diversity in important ways. Basic theory will help us explain how and why these differences matter. My second reason for focusing on diversity is data availability. A few years ago, you could find only a handful of studies of the impact of identity diversity on businesses, organizations, and schools. Today, the number of such studies is enormous and growing. In ecology, there are several studies that analyze ecological robustness as a function of species diversity. And the fossil record itself, offers a compelling time series on the rise and fall of diversity levels. There are also data sets on language, cultural, and product diversity, not to mention diversity in clothing, gestures, and architecture. My final motivation stems from the scientific questions, which, absent public interest, would remain compelling. Why does diversity arise? Do systems tend to evolve too much diversity or too little? Can simple interventions tune diversity to the ensure robustness or efficiency? Does agent?level diversity increase system level efficiency? Or, does the context determine the answer? So economists would see diversity as good but some sociologists seeing it as creating problems. Does diversity increase robustness, as ecologists suggest? Or is the relationship more complex, as political scientists might argue, on the one hand pointing to uprisings in Uganda and the former Yugoslavia as examples where diversity provided fuel for nationalistic uprisings. While on the other hand, demonstrating that one cause of the Civil War was an economic cleavage between the South and the North and the lack of natural coalitions that crossed the Mason Dixon line. So, in this case, a lack of diversity fueled the secession movement. It appears that a complete theory of the interplay between diversity and robustness must explain why economic diversity ensures robustness, but ethnic diversity undermines it. My theory building process has three steps: first, building a suite of computational models to generate insights; second, the derivation of general theories, concepts, and insights; and third, the creation of a representative computational model that captures the main features of the theory. I have begun or completed three projects in the area of diversity and complexity. Lu Hong, a mathematical economist, and I develop a model of diverse problem solving agents endowed with perspectives (problem representations) and heuristics (thinking tools). We create thousands of agents and form teams of problems solvers who attempt to find good solutions to difficult problems. Surprisingly, we find that teams of randomly selected, intelligent problem solvers outperform teams comprised of the best problem solvers. We prove mathematically why this occurs; the random selection of agents is more diverse. This relationship between diversity and optimality is generic. Results such as these can influence how we interpret phenomena. They tell us that we should maintain and encourage intellectual diversity, that thermometer measures of intelligence, though possibly correlated with heuristic breadth and depth, sweep important attributes under the table, that universities should be looking for people with the ability to think differently, and that the person who finds the cure or makes the scientific breakthrough need not be the only one who deserves credit. The real breakthrough may have been an overlooked contribution of someone else. Alternatively, when someone makes a huge contribution it may owe as much to that person thinking about the problem differently than it does with that person being intelligent in the traditional sense. In the second project, Jenna Bednar, a political scientist, and I show how agents adapt cognitive tools that depend upon the ensemble of games that they play. We cast this as a model of \"games\" theory as opposed to game theory. We provide an explanation for cultural differences: they emerge because societies confront distinct problems and situations, and people adapt their cognitive skills to their environments. In our formulation, the level of cooperation in a culture may be a function of the number of strategic interactions in which people benefit by being cooperative. In two papers published in the American Economic Review, Henrich has found empirical support for this idea. Finally, in sole authored work, I show how humans choosing economic routes--where and when to shop for food, buy gas, go out to eat, etc.--evolve collections of routes which are efficient but not fully robust. My intuition is that this cannot be true for all systems. Other systems must evolve robustness at the expense of efficiency. The eventual theory of diversity will provide us with a common understanding of the nature and importance of differences. We may find that only some types of diversity should be embraced. We may find that some systems generate more diversity than we need and that others produce less. We may discover that the types of diversity necessary for efficiency are distinct from those needed for robustness. At the completion of this project, we will not have developed a complete theory, but we will have made significant progress in that direction. We intend to take what we have learned to produce models and templates that can be used in courses in diversity theory. These courses will have a scientific basis, something lacking in the present undergraduate curricula, management books, and political manifestos that address diversity. We will convene educators and other interested parties in an outreach effort in an effort to change how \"diversity\" is taught and understood. In sum, this project will move us from merely recognizing diversity to a deeper understanding of it. Presently, we work to preserve it in our environment, and we require it in our schools. Our business and political leaders speak of harnessing and exploiting it. Yet, we lack the subtle understanding of diversity that can only come from a solid theoretical Foundation. In this project, we intend to begin building that Foundation.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Michigan - Ann Arbor', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002040\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '419,655', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The wish or expectation of a brain cancer patient is the wish or desire to be cured. They would then expect the physician following the diagnosis to be able to provide a therapy that would fulfill this desire. Unfortunately, for the majority of brain cancers, this is not the case. At best what can be provided is a small extension of the person's life with the quality of life during this extended time period being poor. The other aspect is the frustration of physicians lacking the tools or therapies to provide hope for curing these patients. This is where I hope through my research to increase the arsenal of effective therapies for clinicians to treat this disease. Before delving into how we will develop brain cancer therapies, let's better understand the deficiencies of the existing therapies. Diagnosis of brain tumors is the result of altered behavior, dizziness, disorientation, impairment of vision or persisting headaches. It can be any one of these symptoms or a group of symptoms. This is the result of the tumor impinging on a nerve or neural process in the brain. Usually, the tumor is large enough to image by either Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Assisted Tomagraph (CAT) scanning. These imaging instruments serve several purposes, one being to determine if the patient has a tumor and the second is to identify the location of the tumors so that they can be surgically removed by a neurosurgeon. These instruments do not provide the surgeon with information to distinguish tumor tissue from non?tumor tissue, resulting in incomplete surgical removal of the cancerous cells. Hence, the need for additional therapy to kill those residual cells either by radiation or chemotherapy. Radiation kills tumor cells by damaging the DNA of the tumor. For effective radiation therapy, the DNA must be exposed in a state of replication. This occurs for a very short period of time in the life cycle of the tumor cell and cell division within the tumor is random. Such that at any one time there is a small fraction of cells undergoing division and consequently a small number of cells susceptible to radiation damage. This can be compensated for by applying multiple dose of radiation a varying time points. However, the radiation will affect non?cancer tissue resulting in limiting the doses that can be applied. Chemotherapy requires that the drug cross the blood brain barrier, diffuse to the cancer cells and be taken up to illicit an effect. There is one new drug currently approved, TEMODAR (temozolimide) that is able to cross the blood brain barrier. One additional problem is that tumors develop drug resistance, so even if the drug were to get to the correct site, it would not be taken up by the cancer cells. The ideal drug would be one that remained at the tumor site for a sufficient period of time to be effective, the drug would not be susceptible to export by the multidrug resistance machinery of the cells and would not be toxic to noncancer cells. Technology has been developed that addresses some of these features in that wafers composed of a biocompatible polymer are impregnated with a cancer drug, carmustine (BCNU), and placed in the tumor cavity after surgery. With time the drug leaches from the wafers and is taken up by cancer cells. The technology yields a slowing of the tumor growth but does not completely eliminate the tumor and as the drug becomes depleted, the tumor returns. The problem is that the wafers do not contain enough drug and readministration requires additional surgery to a site that is already traumatized from the initial surgery. The application of gene therapy to treat this form of cancer deals directly with this supply of drug and the type of drug. Gene therapy is the delivery of genes encoding a therapeutic protein to cells. For cancer, the therapeutic protein can participate directly as a monkey wrench in disconnecting the events leading to cell division. Alternatively, it can be secreted and bind to neighboring cancer cells that sends a signal for the cell to either stop growing or self destruct. Most cells in the human body do not divide, with the exception of the bone marrow and cells of the immune system. The reason that tumors become a problem is because the cells do divide and do so at a rapid aggressive pace. In cancer, the signals inside the cells that prevent cell division are either silenced or deleted. By restoring these signals, cell division can be halted or stalled. Halting or stalling the cells for an abnormal period of time is a signal to the cell that something is wrong and that triggers a self?destruct mechanism that leads to cell death. Through gene therapy, these signals for halting cell division can be restored for a sufficient period of time and in the required quantity to trigger selfdestruction of the tumor cells. The key is in delivery. For the therapy to be effective, 100% of the cells need to either produce the therapeutic protein or have it bind to their surface. Direct administration of the therapeutic protein suffers from the same problem that the BCNU impregnated polymer wafers have, insufficient supply. The next question is how to deliver the gene. Genes can be delivered directly to the tumors however, the injection volume is limited and only those cells in direct contact with the needle tract formed from the injection will receive the genes. A better approach is through the food supply of the tumor, i.e., the blood stream. Because the genes are large, they do not readily enter the cells. The gene can be coated with a material that tricks the cells into thinking it is food, very analogous to the \"Trojan Horse\". Once inside the cell, the gene becomes uncoated and in so doing becomes activated for producing the therapeutic protein. In the tumor, not only do the tumor cells divide but also the cells that make up the tumor blood vessels. Delivering the gene to these cells inhibits them from growing and in so doing, inhibits the formation of new blood vessels that are essential for supplying nutrients to newly dividing tumor cells. In addition, the therapeutic protein can be engineered such that it is secreted from the blood vessel cells into the space between the tumor cells thus providing direct access to the tumor cells. Even though the blood vessels are not dividing, they still have the capacity to produce the therapeutic protein. Hence, the gene therapy can cut off the food supply to the tumor indirectly inhibiting tumor growth and it can also interact with the tumor cells and directly inhibit tumor growth. The other advantage of this technology is that it only impacts dividing cells. So even if it were to be taken up by non?cancerous cells, only those cells that were dividing would be affected. Gene delivery to other tissue can be minimized by injecting the gene delivery system into the blood stream through a tube that is upstream of the tumor. When tumor cells grow, their blood vessels are disorganized due to the rapid rate of growth. The location for insertion of the tube into the blood vessel is such that the first organ the coated genes see is the tumor vasculature. Because it is so disorganized, the genes become trapped in the tumor blood vessels and result in selectively being localized to the tumor. These coated genes can be readministered once a week, every other week or once a month. This type of therapy can be used by itself or in combination with already approved therapy, such as surgery followed by radiation or simply in combination with radiation. The success of this therapy will not only create a new form of brain cancer therapy but it will also be applicable to the treatment of other types of cancer, such as metastases.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Florida', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002029\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '425,401', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

It can affect people at any age but is most commonly found in adults with a peak incidence between 45 and 70 years of age. Glioblastomas tend to be more frequent in males than in females, and a significant portion of the patients are children (as much as 9%). The prognosis for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma is usually poor with the 5-year survival being less than 5%. What makes glioblastoma a particularly insidious disease is the fact that it spreads rapidly within the central nervous system. From the main tumor mass individual tumor cells can migrate away and invade aggressively neighboring normal brain structures. Surgical resection of the tumor almost never cures the disease because small microscopic cohorts of tumor cells which have already migrated away from the main tumor mass are not removed by the surgery. It is these remaining tumor cells that will give rise to recurrent tumors in a relatively short period of time. In most cases, the initial surgical treatment of glioblastoma is followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and these additional treatments help in prolonging patient survival beyond the increased survival achieved by surgery alone. However, a discouraging bottom line remains, despite aggressive treatment most patients die of the disease, with a median survival of about one year. The focus of Dr. Streit's research is to develop a new type of therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma which takes advantage of recent advances made in the field of neuroimmunology. Neuroimmunology combines neuroscience with immunology and most of the research in this area is focused on how immunological processes contribute towards the development of brain disease. The classic example of a `neuroimmunological' disease is multiple sclerosis where the immune system becomes autoaggressive and destroys portions of the central nervous system. Normally, the brain and spinal cord are protected from being attacked by cells of the immune system because the leukocytes (white cells), which are abundant in the blood, are prevented from entering the central nervous system. However, is the exclusion of white cells not dangerous since it leaves the brain unprotected from invading microorganisms? As it turns out, the brain is not at all unprotected because it has its own immune system [Streit and Colton, The brain's immune system, Scientific American, November 1995]. The key component of the brain's immune system are so-called microglial cells. For conceptual purposes, one can think of microglia as crossbreeds between blood-borne white cells and glial cells of the central nervous system (glial cells are cells that support neurons). In other words, microglia share some of the same characteristics as white cells, but they have evolved to live with these potentially dangerous properties inside the brain without causing harm. They are specially adapted immune-competent cells of the brain. One of the properties that microglia share with white cells is their ability to become cytotoxic effector cells. This means that microglia can acquire the ability to kill other cells, including normal brain cells but also brain tumor cells. The ultimate goal of Dr. Streit's research is to learn how to manipulate the cytotoxic ability of microglia and to use it for selectively destroying tumors cells. Perhaps the greatest potential advantage that comes with this strategy is that fact that microglia, which are quite numerous within brain tumors, could be used as microscopical weapons to eliminate those small remaining contingents of brain tumor cells that remain after surgical resection and are responsible for tumor recurrences. Following is a brief summary of microglia in brain tumors and on the mechanisms thought to play a role in controlling interactions between microglial and tumor cells. It has been observed repeatedly that malignant gliomas, both spontaneously occurring ones in humans and experimentally induced ones in rodents, contain large numbers of microglial cells. Many of the microglia observed appear to be activated, suggesting that they are in a functional cytotoxic state that enables them to kill tumor cells. However, tumor cytotoxicity does not seem to occur to any significant extent since glioblastomas continue to thrive and expand eventually killing their victims. Thus, questions have arisen as to how exactly microglia kill tumor cells and why they appear to be unable to do so in the tumor environment. Part of the answers to these questions comes from research involving analysis of tumor and microglia-associated cytokines, small peptides important for mediating cell-cell interactions. Cell culture studies have shown that microglia can kill tumor cells by producing a particular cytokine called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). However, when TNF-a content was analyzed in tissue samples of rat brain tumors, it was found that TNF-a was not being produced in these samples clearly supporting the idea that microglia inside brain tumors are unable to produce the tumorkilling TNF-a. In addition, it turns out that glioblastomas produce large amounts of another cytokine, called transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Beta), which has potent immunosuppressive effects. It has been shown that TGF-Beta, when added to cultured microglial cells, can inhibit their ability to produce TNF-a and to kill glioma cells. The picture that emerges from all of this is that glioma cells can survive immune attack by producing immunosuppressive cytokines, such as TGF-Beta. This relationship between microglia and glioma cells is illustrated schematically in the figure below. The next question in this line of work is, can the immunosuppressive action of tumorderived (TGF-Beta), be overcome by direct immune stimulation of microglial cells inside of brain tumors. In other words, can direct intra-tumoral injection of immune stimulatory agents induce microglial cytotoxicity. This question is precisely the focus of the proposed research. Dr. Streit's laboratory has obtained promising, albeit preliminary, results using injections of bacterial endotoxin and gamma interferon into rat brain tumors. The initial results have shown that these injections result in greatly increased areas of tumor cell death. Since it is known that endotoxin and interferon can stimulate microglia to become cytotoxic for tumor cells in cell culture, these preliminary findings strongly suggest immune stimulation applied directly into a brain tumor has the same effect. The research plan will continue to test and refine the immunostimulatory protocol in rats with glioblastoma, and to follow both treated and untreated animals long term using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The MRI will allow us to determine whether shrinkage of gliomas, and perhaps even eradication, can be achieved using repeat injections of endotoxin and interferon. The proposed work will employ a rat glioma model which has been used in the Streit laboratory since 1992. This model has been characterized extensively and has been found to mimic many of the same features of human glioblastomas, including a high density of microglia and high levels of TGF-P production. One can therefore be reasonably confident that if a successful treatment protocol can be developed for the rat brain tumors, it might be directly applicable for treatment of human patients with glioblastoma and could lead to clinical trials. The proposed immunotherapy could become a follow?up treatment to the initial surgical resection and it could result in the successful removal of microscopic foci of leftover tumor cells which are impossible to remove with current regimens. Elimination of all tumor cells may prevent recurrent tumor formation.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'University of Florida', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002025\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '449,998', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Whatever course is taken to try to meet this demand, it is fair to expect that growing anthropogenic pressures will put biodiversity at great risk. Food production is arguably humanity's most important activity, and ecosystems and their biodiversity supply critical benefits to agriculture. Yet the conversion of native habitats to agricultural uses is also the most important proximate cause of biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption worldwide. The tradeoffs involved here are complex; they are fraught with uncertainty, non-linearity, and vexing dilemmas, both practical and ethical in nature. The fact is that ecosystems are changing with ever greater rapidity, and with consequences that feed into economic, political, climatological, epidemiological, and other important systems. My focus is on extinction. Of the many dimensions of global change, none has problems of irreversibility more serious than extinction. What are the societal impacts of biodiversity loss and other ecosystem changes? Which merit the most attention? What levels and types of changes are acceptable? And what institutions and policies will be effective in sustaining both agricultural productivity and the delivery of ecosystem services? To refine our approach to such questions, we must recognize that ecosystems are capital assets: if properly managed, they yield a flow of vital services. Ecosystem services include the production of goods, such as seafood, timber, and precursors to many industrial and pharmaceutical products. They also include basic life-support processes (such as pollination, water purification, and climate regulation), life-fulfilling conditions (such as serenity, beauty, and cultural inspiration), and preservation of options (such as conserving genetic and species diversity for future use). Proper accounting would value the flow of ecosystem services while costing out the depreciation of the underlying asset, just as for physical capital, for example. Unfortunately, relative to other forms of capital, ecosystem capital is poorly understood, scarcely monitored, and, in many important cases, undergoing rapid degradation and depletion. These circumstances demand urgent attention. My research is aimed at answering three fundamental questions. First, what sorts of species and ecosystems will be with us (remain extant or assemble / evolve) over the coming decades and centuries? Second, what sorts do we want to retain? And, third, how can we achieve what we desire? Clearly these are complex questions, each having many important dimensions in the natural and social sciences, and outside of academia in the real world of human activity and policy. I am presently working with a diverse array of collaborators on aspects of each. The focus of my research program in Costa Rica, and the subject of this grant application, is the ecological aspects of the first two questions. On the question of the ecosystems of the future, I am trying to characterize the dynamics of biodiversity and ecosystem change in human-dominated, \"countryside\" habitats in the tropics, a topic which has received relatively little attention to date. The organisms that can take advantage of countryside - rural and suburban landscapes devoted primarily to human activities - deserve more attention, for a series of reasons. First, it is unlikely that many large, undisturbed tracts of natural habitat will remain in the face of projected growth in the size and environmental impacts of the human population. Second, the conservation potential for many species may rest on preserving or enhancing certain aspects of rural landscapes containing remnants of native habitat, in lieu of protecting large tracts of undisturbed habitat. Third, the supply of important ecosystem system services, such as pest control and pollination, will depend in many instances on the biodiversity that occurs locally, in agricultural, or countryside, habitats. Finally, a growing interest in restoration in some regions will require comparing the potential of alternative sites for reestablishing desired ecosystems. With a group of collaborators, I am documenting and analyzing patterns of occurrence, movement, and resource use of different groups of organisms in native and agricultural habitats embedded within landscapes of varying land-use intensity. The aim is to use changes in land use as a basis for forecasting changes in biodiversity and ecosystems. At the same time, we are attempting to determine the utility of different groups of organisms as indicators of change. We have ongoing studies of birds, butterflies, moths, beetles, and mammals and are presently planning to investigate floristic aspects of change. Our findings suggest that (i) different groups of organisms respond quite differently to changes in land use, and therefore do not serve well alone as indicators of other groups at the local scale (<1000ha); (ii) generally speaking, about 50% of the species in these major groups occur in some agricultural habitats; (iii) the relationship between biodiversity and land-use intensity (using various measures) is highly non-linear for most groups. We are now in the process of testing the generality of these initial findings in four biogeographically and ecologically distinct regions of Costa Rica, using birds - the best known and most readily sampled part of the fauna. We are also testing the utility of Landsat satellite images in predicting the occurrence of species across complex, human-dominated landscapes. Postdoctoral fellow Sallie Bailey and I are applying the latest techniques in land classification and image interpretation to see whether we can predict patterns of biodiversity across broader regions of the tropics. Together these efforts are yielding insights to the ecosystems of the future. On the second question, Which species and ecosystems do we want to retain?, I am beginning to investigate the ecological function of particular landscape elements and species. I am doing this in part by researching (in the literature) the ecological roles known to be played by the different groups that we are studying (birds, mammals, etc.). In addition, postdoctoral fellow Taylor Ricketts is launching a project to assess the value of native habitats in supplying pollinators to coffee plantations. Preliminary data suggest that, although the most commonly grown coffee varieties are self-pollinated, the bean is larger and longer-lived if it results from cross-pollination. Moreover, local farmers claim that the principal pollinators (bees and wasps) nest in forest. We are now poised to put our initial observations, and those of other researchers, into a theoretical framework. The development of theory is critical to predicting future changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. It will allow us to clarify, contrast, and test alternative assumptions about the mechanisms underlying the patterns we see. It would thereby also inform the future course of the empirical work on these issues. While much theory exists that could be usefully applied to this work, I also hope to develop some new approaches. With graduate student Henrique Pereira, I have initiated the development of simple models relating land-use intensity to species richness and composition. The work is promising but there is a great deal of room for exploration. I propose to apply a McDonnell Award to hiring a postdoctoral fellow to expand and intensify efforts on this front. In summary, our findings so far suggest that there is considerable potential for conserving or enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services in countryside habitats. The next major step is to develop a predictive framework for interpreting these findings over the long term and over broader geographic regions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Stanford University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002074\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '197,207', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

The very presence of synchronization almost always has an element November full moon, corals synchronize by collectively releasing millions of gametes in an extraordinary large-scale mass- the insect world. Certain Asian firefly species are famous for their ability to gather in dense swarms where they rhythmically flash on and off in perfect unison, in a dizzying synchronized display of courtship. Equally curious is the manner in which many animal populations are able to collectively synchronize over enormous spatial scales, sometimes over continents. For the classic ten-year Canadian hare-lynx cycle, populations from different regions have been tightly synchronized for hundreds of years now, creating one of Ecology's greatest enigmas. Mathematically, the principles driving synchronization are reasonably well understood for systems that are periodic; far less is known for systems that are erratic or chaotic. Complex systems theory has helped to explain why the presence of nonlinearities in the simplest of oscillating systems can generate irregular but bounded and persistent oscillations. Despite the manner in which tiny differences chaotic systems, it is possible for two such oscillators to quickly synchronize to one another if, like Huygens's clocks, they are weakly coupled. Yet the synchronization is not always easy to identify. Sometimes it is subtle, and can only be detected after applying special mathematical techniques. Sometimes the synchronization appears and disappears erratically. On other occasions, there may be a \"phase-synchronization\" which holds only between the phase or rhythm of the signals, while the chaotic amplitudes (magnitudes of the oscillations) curiously remain largely uncorrelated. As discussed below, these complex forms of synchronization may be the key to understanding and predicting events in contexts that vary from flu epidemics to the extinction of endangered species, yet the basic notions have only just begun to be explored. In the current ecological paradigm, which stresses the study of \"metapopulations\" ( of spatially interconnected subpopulations), the and synchronicity of subpopulations can have decisive consequences for the conservation of species. When subpopulations are asynchronous, extinction \"diluted\" through the metapopulation. Should any external disturbances endanger or even extinguish a local population, asynchrony ensures that contrast, when subpopulations are strongly synchronized, disturbances can often be hazardous. For example, if subpopulations are at relatively low levels to begin with, a disturbance might result in all subpopulations synchronizing to extinction. The ideas are just as relevant for understanding disease dynamics, where extinction rather than persistence of a disease is the preferred scenario, and synchronization may act to enhance this. Many of the existing theories concerning metapopulation dynamics and synchronization are derived from the analysis of mathematical \"maps\", often referred to as \"toy\" models because of their simplicity. My aim is to but Chaotic Amplitudes). Although UPCA is characteristic of numerous ecological and biological systems, such as the Canadian hare-lynx cycle mentioned above, rthermore, the introduction of small levels of migration between such models can lead to a whole range of synchronization behaviors and points to a rich unexplored area of research awaiting study. For spatially structured ecosystems, population \"waves\" bounce around the spatial landscape and the effects of pattern-formation enter the picture. Spatial traveling wave patterns have been noted in a wide range of dispersing species, and also emerge naturally in lattice structures of spatially connected foodweb models coupled via migration. The foodweb models are intrinsically chaotic, yet the traveling waves they generate through their mutual synchronization are often highly ordered with periodic phase structure. Little is known about the spatio-temporal structures associated with complex synchronization, but they have important implications for conservation ecology. If, for example, a disturbance perturbs a local patch-population to the brink of extinction, the periodicity of spatial phase-synchronization guarantees the recurring arrival of wave fronts in which new colonizers can buffer endangered populations. This stands in contrast to the common view mentioned above, that population synchronization accelerates global extinctions. Another important aspect of synchronization is the manner in which ecological communities entrain to periodic environmental or climatic driving variables. Many organisms have no choice but to synchronize their life cycle to the seasons by thriving only in a small \"window\" of the larger annual cycle, when resources are most favorable. In Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel, for example, seasonal stratification and nutrient availability patterns ensure that almost every March a large-scale algae bloom appears. As in many other freshwater lakes, the presence of a phytoplankton bloom signals dangerous nutrient loading (eutrophication) and water quality problems, making the study of phytoplankton blooms absolutely vital adds a complicating factor to the study of bloom dynamics since it can induce irregular chaotic oscillations synchronized to the seasonal cycle. The explosive nonlinear growth of the Kinneret bloom has all the hallmarks one might expect for a synchronized chaotic process, with some erratic years when a threshold effect prevents the bloom from appearing (analogous to the dynamic features of epidemics). As yet there is little theoretical understanding of the nutrient-driven dynamics of phytoplankton blooms, their temporal synchronization and their spatial pattern-formation mechanisms. Yet such an understanding should prove helpful for dealing with the water resource problems we face at the dawn of this new millennium. In the same spirit but in the context of epidemiology, synchronization has great control over the (often chaotic) dynamics of diseases as they spread through complex networks of suburbs and cities. With current patterns of globalization, major diseases are transmitted from airport to airport across the globe, passed along via traveling human cargo. This increasing \"connectance\" between distantly related cities dramatically changes the transmission dynamics of infections, and the methods for studying spatio-temporal synchronization should provide powerful tools for investigating such scenarios. Many epidemic oscillations are characterized by inherent UPCA-like dynamics, yet conventional models are incapable of reproducing this behavior. The UPCA models I am developing should provide a technical-fix and form the basis of a theoretical study of complex spatio-temporal synchronization under different realistic scenarios. Existing long-term epidemiological data sets are characterized by a variety of complex synchronizations and will provide an unexplored test-bed for complementing this study. Finally, theoretical ideas of synchronization may be harnessed to design optimal vaccination schedules. Both \"pulse vaccination\" and modern chaos-control are techniques that have the potential to induce spatio-temporal synchronization in regional networks, and thereby increase the extinction probabilities of infections.  he interplay between theoretical investigations and the observation of natural systems is thus expected to lead to new advances and insights in our understanding of synchronization processes, in general, and the way they contribute to the self-organization of large complex systems.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Tel Aviv University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002078\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

This social group membership, he contends, is his primary identification in society and because of negative attitudes towards his social group, he is treated unfairly. In this millenial year it is somewhat shocking, yet at the same time not surprising, that incidents like those alleged by Mr. Glover still occur. Although at one time there were social norms and laws that dictated the attitudes towards racial groups, since the civil rights movement of the 1960's these social norms have changed. One result of these changes is that the endorsement of prejudicial attitudes has dramatically declined over the last several decades. However as the incident described above illustrates, this dramatic decline in stated racial attitudes has not accompanied a similar decline in societal racial problems. Social psychologists have suggested this discrepancy between reported attitudes and behavior may be due to the fact that the influence of attitudes is much more subtle and pervasive than is suggested by measures of self-report. There are two reasons why these self-report measures may not mirror behavioral responses. First, individuals may be reluctant to admit that they endorse certain prejudicial attitudes. It is likely that the cab drivers mentioned above would not express negative attitudes towards Blacks (especially to the TLC), yet they still intentionally avoided Mr. Glover. Second, it has more recently been suggested that we may not always be consciously aware of our biased behavioral responses. This type of unintentional social group bias is reflected in the recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) report on gender discrimination, which found a \"pervasive and unintentional\" pattern of discrimination against female faculty. In his commentary, MIT Dean Robert Birgeneau, stated: \"I believe that in no case was this discrimination conscious or deliberate. Indeed it was totally unconscious and unknowing.\" Using indirect behavioral measures, social psychologists are beginning to differentiate between social responses and attitudes that are purposeful and direct (explicit) and those that are unintentional and indirect (implicit). Explicit attitudes are those we consciously express and often believe to be true. Implicit attitudes are expressed through our behavior, without our conscious awareness and/or control. While our explicit attitudes may reflect the ideals that we endorse, our implicit attitudes may reflect our underlying knowledge of cultural norms, our own social group membership, and our personal experience. These implicit attitudes may or may not be consistent with our explicit attitudes. For instance, in contrast to studies showing relatively unbiased explicit evaluations of Black Americans by White Americans, there is robust evidence for negative evaluations using implicit or indirect measures. This research provides scientific confirmation of the sentiments long expressed by members of underrepresented social groups. Even though we now have laws against prejudicial acts, and even though many individuals may be well intentioned, cultural stereotypes of social groups exert a subtle but real influence on behavior. Social psychologists have approached this problem by identifying personal and social group factors related to the direct and indirect expression of social attitudes. I propose another approach. It is equally important to understand the specific mechanisms of learning and expression that underlie these behaviors. Are we endowed with special cognitive and neural mechanisms to learn and express our social attitudes? Or do we learn and express social attitudes using the same systems we use to evaluate non-social, emotional stimuli? In other words, can we show that social learning and evaluation are rooted in the ordinary mechanics of mind and brain. Recent research on the basic cognitive and neural mechanisms of emotional learning has suggested some links to studies of social attitudes. Much in the same way that social psychologists differentiate direct and indirect means of social evaluation, cognitive neuroscientists have identified brain mechanisms related to the direct or indirect expression of learned emotional responses. Studies conducted across a range of species have shown that the amygdala is a critical brain structure in emotional learning. Recent research conducted in my lab and others has shown that in humans, the amygdala's role in emotional learning is often limited to the indirect expression of the emotional response. For example, it is a classic finding that when people are startled (for instance, by a loud noise) in the presence of negative stimuli (e.g, a dark, empty street) this startle response will be enhanced or potentiated. This startle potentiation indirectly indicates the emotional evaluation of the stimulus. We have shown that patients with amygdala damage, in contrast to normal controls, do not exhibit this startle potentiation in the presence of negative, non-social stimuli. At the same time, these patients rate these stimuli as equally arousing and negative as control subjects. In other words, they are able to explicitly report the emotional evaluation of the stimuli, even though they do not show an implicit or indirect emotional response. The performance of these patients is in contrast to the performance of patients with damage to a neighboring brain structure, the hippocampus. Hippocampal damage results in the opposite pattern; patients are able to indirectly express an emotional response to a stimulus through behavior, even though they cannot explicitly report the emotional significance of the stimulus. Thus, different cognitive and neural systems underlie the direct and indirect expression of affective evaluation. Investigations into both social attitudes and the cognitive neuroscience of emotional learning have reported dissociations between indirect and direct affective evaluation. These common results led to me to wonder if similar mechanisms underlie these two types of findings. Could amygdala activity be related to the indirect evaluation of social groups? In order to test this hypothesis, we examined activity in the amygdala in White American subjects while they viewed pictures of unfamiliar White and Black male faces. Subjects were given three measures of social evaluation. One was an explicit, self-report of racial attitudes. The other two were indirect, behavioral assessments of racial evaluation. Although the majority of White subjects showed greater amygdala activity to the Black compared to White faces, there was significant variability among the subjects. When we examined the relationship between amygdala response and measures of social evaluation, we found that the White subjects who showed greater amygdala activity to the Black vs. White faces also showed stronger biases in social responses on our indirect measures. This same relationship was not found with our direct measure of social attitudes. In other words, the amount of amygdala activity to the Black vs. White faces was specifically related to indirect social responses. These results suggest that the same neural systems that underlie the indirect expression of emotional learning to non-social stimuli are also related to the indirect expression of social responses. In an effort to understand some of the variables related to these results, we performed a second study identical to the first, with one exception. The Black and White faces belonged to well known and positively regarded individuals (e.g., Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy). In this study, there was no consistent pattern of amygdala activity to Black vs. White faces in the White subjects and no relation between amygdala activity and any of our behavioral measures of evaluation. These results suggest that the amygdala's response to Black faces in White subjects is diminished with specific experience, familiarity, and positive evaluation. These are the first studies to link the evaluation of social groups to brain activity. By creating this link we add what we know about the cognitive function of these neural systems for emotional learning to our understanding of social evaluation and attitudes. These preliminary studies start to delineate mechanisms involved in social evaluation, but they also raise several crucial questions. For instance, what factors are related to the variability observed among the White subjects? What kind of responses would we expect from members of other racial groups, such as Black Americans and Asian Americans? What other brain regions are related to social evaluation and what are their behavioral roles? Precisely how does familiarity, positive information, or specific experience with members of different social groups alter the neural systems of social evaluation? In the proposed research we aim to address these questions. By identifying the cognitive and neural mechanisms of social responses we can initiate discovery of the means by which they are learned and modulated. In his complaint to the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Glover requested that New York City cab drivers receive diversity training. How can we be sure this diversity training changes the explicit and implicit mechanisms of social evaluation? Given what we know about learned emotional responses in general, what types of training might be most effective at altering both direct and indirect social evaluations? Understanding the complex mechanisms underlying social responses will help us answer these questions.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'New York University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/20002077\\n', 'year': '2000', 'amount': '450,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Several treatments have failed to alter patient survivals beyond 12 months of diagnosis. We hypothesize that flavopiridol, a novel cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, would be a promising drug treatment for GBM due to its dual capacity to deplete cells of cyclin D1, an important co-factor for CDK4 activation and cell cycle arrest, and to deplete cells of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), a protein up-regulated in response to hypoxia promoting bloodvessel formation. Over 80% of adult GBM show inactivation of the Rb tumor suppressor pathway due to overexpression of cyclin D1, mutationsin the Rb gene or loss of the negative regulator p161NK4a. In addition, HIF-1a expression in GBM is significantly associated with density of blood vessels within a tumor and tumor grade. Blood vesselformation or angiogenesis is a critical step required for sustained growth and progression of GBM. We have developed an experimental mouseglioma model which demonstrates distinct stages of tumor growth and neovascularization, including an identical expression pattern of HIF 1a as in human GBM. We demonstrate that high resolution contrast enhanced perfusion micro magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI) canbe used to monitor the efficacy of potential drugs tested in the GL261 animal model on tumor growth and angiogenic activity.

They are giving you hundreds of thousands of dollars that you desperately need to do the experiments you've always dreamed of doing. How do you feel? What are you thinking? What might you decide to do next? It seems apparent that your thoughts and your behavior would be greatly influenced by the emotion that you feel upon hearing this news. No doubt, you would have felt, thought, and acted differently had the news been negative. One doesn't have to win an award or to lose a loved one to realize that nearly every waking moment of our lives is imbued with emotion. While we can all agree that emotions influence our lives, it is somewhat unclear what exactly they are good for. Does it help you to feel elated at winning the award, or would life be just the same if we had no emotions? A fundamental problem that all organisms face is how to select, from a plethora of stimuli as inputs and a wide array of possible behaviors as outputs, which actions to take in response to which stimuli. Without such an ability to assign relevance to stimuli and actions, any system is quickly overwhelmed--a problem that confronts those who are attempting to construct artificially intelligent systems today. The brain has a number of ways of providing selection; that selection which occurs on the basis of the value (ultimately, value in terms of an organism's survival) of a particular stimulus or action is the core topic of emotion. Emotion guides our attention towards what is important, permits us to remember what matters, and leads us to make choices that, more often than not, are in our best interest. A human life entirely without emotion would be not just bland, it would mean death. In our above example, it is clear that multiple events would have occurred: you perceived the words in the letter, your brain processed their meaning and triggered an emotion, and the emotion altered your attention, your memory for the event, and the decisions you subsequently made. From introspection, as well as from studies in cognitive psychology, we know something about the component processes described here. The question I want to address is how these processes are implemented in the human brain. Answers to this question have been slow to emerge, in large part a consequence of the relative neglect of emotion within cognitive neuroscience, until rather recently. Ever since Aristotle described humans as rational animals, emotion has been viewed as distinct from reason. In the past decade or two, we have begun to realize that emotion is simply one particular aspect of how the brain processes information, an aspect that permits an organism to link representations of external stimuli and events with self-representations of its body state. It is this juxtaposition of information about the outside world and about the internal world of the organism's own body that permits an evaluation of stimuli in terms of the survival-related meaning they have for the organism. Recent findings in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion have come from studies of patients with damage to particular regions of their brain, as well as from functional imaging studies (such as PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging) of normal individuals. These studies have indicated that there are certain structures in the brain, notably including the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex, that are responsible for associating sensory stimuli (like the words on the page) with their emotional meaning. Patients with lesions to these regions of the brain may be unable to recognize emotions from stimuli, and may be unable to guide their behavior on the basis of how they feel; consequently they are often severely impaired in their everyday lives. While prior studies of human emotion have pointed to particular structures, they have been unable to describe how emotion is processed in great detail. In particular, they have been unable to investigate precisely the detailed mechanisms whereby the cells within these structures process emotional information at various points in time. These are questions which have instead been addressed in animals, by inserting electrodes into the brain to measure the responses of individual neurons. In the past four years, my colleagues and I have begun to apply microelectrode recordings from single neurons also to the human brain. Such studies, of course, cannot be done solely for research purposes, but rely on a clinical setting. All of our patients have epilepsy that cannot be controlled adequately by medication, and are thus candidates for neurosurgical resection of the brain tissue that is causing the epilepsy. To guide such a resection, the neurosurgeon implants electrodes into their brains so that the location of seizure foci can be accurately determined. However, the patients can also participate in our research studies at the same time that they undergo clinical monitoring. The electrodes are typically in the brain for 1-2 weeks, and during that time we show the patients pictures, have them listen to sounds, and have them watch film clips while we record from neurons in their brain. Our findings so far have been quite dramatic. In one series of studies, we showed patients pictures that varied in terms of their emotional content--pleasant pictures of babies and food, neutral pictures of chairs and tables, and aversive pictures of dead or mutilated people. When we recorded from neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex, we observed a change in the firing pattern of neurons only when the patient saw the aversive pictures, but not when he saw pleasant or neutral pictures. Several aspects of this experiment were novel. First, we were able to localize the precise region of the brain from which we recorded these responses. Our electrodes had electrical contacts at particular locations, and we obtained magnetic resonance scans of the patient's brain after the electrodes had been implanted. Second, we measured the response from a neuron with millisecond precision. In this way, we were able to show that the responses to the aversive pictures first occurred 120 milliseconds after the picture appeared on the screen. This is amazingly fast: it is almost certainly faster than it would take the patient to become consciously aware of the picture that he saw. In fact, 120 milliseconds is so fast that the brain only has time for a handful of processing steps--yet, evidently, that small number of steps is sufficient to permit the brain to discriminate the picture as aversive. The issue of timing is of very general importance. Think back to our original example of the letter. What happens in time? Clearly, you don't start out feeling joyous and relieved (if you are like me, when you first open the letter you feel rather tense and worried). Then you see the words in the letter. A second later you do indeed feel joyous and relieved, and this emotion evolves over the course of the next several seconds or minutes and then gradually subsides. What events in your brain correspond to these changes? We are investigating this question by recording the activity from several brain structures over some length of time after the initial appearance of a stimulus. Our eventual goal is to describe the flow of information in the brain: where in the brain and at what point in time is information about the perceptual visual attributes of a stimulus processed? Where and when is information about the emotional significance of the stimulus processed? And what are the neuronal correlates of subsequently encoding the stimulus into memory or making a particular decision to act? While these are large and difficult questions, to be sure, they are becoming tractable as we combine methods such as studies of lesion patients, or studies involving functional imaging, with rare opportunities to record from single neurons in neurosurgical patients. In addition to answering questions about how emotion is processed by healthy brains, our research has important implications for disorders in which emotion is processed pathologically. Nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder features a dysfunction in emotion: schizophrenia, autism, depression, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder are all, to a large extent, disorders of emotion. How is it that some people are unaffected by certain situations or stimuli, whereas others are plunged into depression or panic? We believe that a part of the answer will involve pathological function within the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, structures whose detailed function our studies are beginning to elucidate. But the overall aims of research on emotion go beyond our curiosity about how the brain works, and go beyond accruing information that can be of clinical help. Emotions are so pervasive, and play such a key role in activities ranging from politics to science to art, that a better understanding of emotion in a very general sense will give us a deeper understanding of who we are as human beings.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'The University of Iowa', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002034\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '387,000', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Estimates of the magnitude of species extinction vary greatly, but some suggest that several species are lost each hour. Largely, this is due to human influence: humans now dominate all global environmental systems through resource consumption and land use, resulting in levels of extinction rivaling those causing the disappearance of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous or marine invertebrates at the end of the Permian era. Modern-day human-caused extinctions irreversibly terminate the products of hundreds of millions of years of evolution, and also threaten the life support systems on which we depend. Ecosystems, and the biodiversity that they contain, provide us with a flow of goods and services vital to our existence. These include purification of our air and water, stabilization of our climate, generation of soil, prevention of flooding and soil loss, pollination of our crops, pest-control, production of fish, forests, and non-timber products including vital medicines, and generation of life-fulfilling conditions, such as aesthetic and recreation pleasure. To stem the growing tide of extinction, conservationists have proposed and fieldtested a variety of strategies over the past century, with varying success. Early strategies for conservation aimed to protect biodiversity by establishing reserves that were offlimits to people, and disregarded the often-negative social and economic consequences of such policies. These strategies were replaced in the late 80's by a paradigm seeking more equitable and long-lasting ways to balance human and wildlife needs: involving local people in co-management of protected areas for the dual goal of sustainable resource use and biodiversity conservation. Recently, however, such integrated models have come under fire due to their limited success, leading to a resurgence of advocacy for strict nature reserves. In contrast, another new strategy is emerging that seeks to integrate human and wildlife needs in a novel way: here, ecosystems are seen as valuable \"natural capital\" that produce a flow of goods and services of value to humans. Creative new financing mechanisms aim to preserve these ecosystem service values by recompensing land owners for stewarding services that traditionally had no market value, such as the production of clean water or the sequestration of carbon. Along with other conservationists, I have been deeply involved over the past 13 years in testing some of these strategies in countries as different as Madagascar and the USA. I have seen limited successes and absolute failures, and thus my quest for alternative conservation strategies continues. My current work focuses on testing this latest approach to conservation: the ecosystem service model. While promising, it is not yet clear whether ecosystem service arguments can always provide sufficient economic motivation for conserving biodiversity. Ecosystem services can be provided by a spectrum of ecosystems, from pristine, natural habitats to restored or highly disturbed systems. When services could be generated more economically from highly modified systems (e.g. using fast-growing non-native tree plantations rather than slower-growing native plant communities to fix nitrogen and stabilize soils), ecosystem arguments are unlikely to generate support for biodiversity conservation. Ecosystems are inherently complex and unpredictable; managing them for financial benefit can therefore be risky since we still lack much basic information. Many land-owners and investors may therefore steer clear of stewarding services for their cash values. Finally, the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function is still unclear. The strategy for using the value of ecosystem services to promote conservation of biological diversity relies upon a positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem function. While some studies support this positive relationship, others suggest that only a few species are sufficient to provide ecosystem function. Only a few services have been studied to date, however, so we still lack fundamental information about the relationship between diversity and ecological function. If natural or restored ecosystems cannot provide ecosystem services in some or all cases, it is important to know this and to develop alternative motivations and policies for biodiversity conservation. Alternatively, if they can, we need to understand ecosystem functions better in order to manage them for their service value. In particular, we need to understand the complex relationships between ecosystem services and biological diversity, their value to humans, and the influence of alternative land-use management strategies upon them. To this end, two years ago, I began to study pollination services in California. Initially I asked the question, do patches of natural habitat in the landscape around farms enhance the diversity and abundance of native bee pollinators, and thus the level of pollination services that crops experience? There are over 4000 species of native bees in North America alone; so far we have found over 20 species visiting several agricultural crops at our study sites. My preliminary results suggest that crops on farms near natural habitat patches benefit greatly from the higher abundance of native bee pollinators found there, presumably because these patches of natural habitat provide bees with resources critical for their own survival and reproduction. This study is especially topical because of a growing concern about declines in vertebrate and invertebrate pollinator populations around the globe. As pollinators go extinct, then the plants that they pollinate (including many crops that we ourselves rely upon for food) will no longer be able to reproduce. Failures of critical ecological linkages such as plant-pollinator interactions can also have cascading effects throughout ecological communities, causing other organisms to suffer from scarce resources or even to go extinct themselves. In my McDonnell Foundation proposal, I am asking four sets of interrelated questions aimed at understanding the values of the services native bee communities provide to us, and how we might manage the landscape to enhance those services for our own benefit. o : How important are native bee pollinators for crop pollination, and what is the value of the service they provide? Is this value sufficient to motivate conservation and/or restoration of natural habitat? If not, what other ecosystem services could the natural habitat provide? Could the total ecosystem service value provide sufficient value to motivate conservation? This information can be used to generate an economic motivation for restoring pollination services across the landscape, and is a critical element for determining an optimal allocation of land between agriculture and conservation to maximize pollination service and other service values. o : How are these pollination services related to biological diversity of pollinators? Does pollinator diversity confer an insurance value for maintaining pollination services to crops that will increase ecological \"resilience\" to ecological change such as global warming? These studies address the fundamental question of the role of biodiversity in maintaining are life support systems. o : How do these pollination services vary across the landscape? Do they depend on the proximity, abundance, diversity and/or composition of natural habitat? Do native pollinators move between natural and agricultural habitats? These studies will allow us to design explicit restoration strategies that will maximize maintenance of pollination services. o : What resources in natural habitats or agricultural habitats are required to maintain populations of native pollinators? What areas of natural habitat are required to maintain bee populations sufficient to provide agricultural pollination services? These studies will allow us to identify the optimal allocation of land uses to maximize pollination services across the landscape; My project is a \"demonstration project\": a detailed case study on the economic value and ecological conditions affecting management of a specific ecosystem function of value to humans. Ultimately, the objective of my research is to go beyond investigating pollination services and their dependency on biodiversity, in order to develop and implement management plans that will maintain pollination services across natural and human-dominated landscapes. Case studies are also the first step towards \"scaling up\" to generalize to other systems and locales. I will use the results from this study, in conjunction with related work that I am conducting on other ecosystem services at other scales, to assess when ecosystem arguments can provide adequate motivation for biodiversity conservation, and to draw general conclusions about the policy and economic issues of conserving, restoring, and managing ecosystem services using natural ecosystems. The funds from the McDonnell Foundation would allow my research team and I to generate conceptual and mathematical models that explore complex systems at the interface of ecology, economics, and policy towards better environmental management.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Princeton University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002036\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '448,916', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Although I did not mind Taco Bell as a fast-food option, I found this ad exceptionally aversive. Intrigued by my strong feelings against it (which were nothing like the usual inattention that most other advertisements receive), I scrutinized it, but to no avail. Containing only an appetizing taco, with a clean and aesthetic hand holding it, this ad, and my obsession with it, remained a puzzle. Then one day I was driving and about to merge with traffic, just ahead of an approaching bus. Glancing ever so briefly to the left and returning my gaze to the right, I was left with the impression that the bus carried an ad on its side, depicting a cobra snake in a ready-to-bite position. So I looked again, and noticed that it was the Taco Bell ad. The configuration of the arm with the taco was associated in my mind with a snake. Studying nonconscious perception at the time, I interpreted this observation as the closure for which I was looking: visual elements in the picture influenced my impression about it non-consciously, such that my attitude towards this ad was negative. At some level it reminded me of an intimidating snake. The first impression of repulsion persisted, although consciously I realized there was nothing negative about the picture. This is an example of a phenomenon that often occurs in everyday social interaction with the environment: we form our first impressions of people and objects very early (first couple of hundred milliseconds), without being aware of the sources that influenced these impressions. These first impressions then persist, often in spite of subsequent perception of contradictory information. A great deal has already been revealed about the social nature of first impressions. Very little, however, is known about the perceptual and cortical basis underlying the formation and persistence of first impressions. What are the actual physical elements of an object that make us like it, hate it, or be afraid of it? What brain processes facilitatethe blazingly fast formation of first impressions, and what in the brain mediates the persistence of early impressions? First impressions are often accurate, and they facilitate our survival and interaction with the environment. For example, humans and monkeys are excellent at judging threat, dominance and hierarchy following a single glance at a picture. Some first impressions, however, are less accurate and subsequently misguide our behavior in a less desirable manner. For example, in a court situation, it has been shown that defendant attractiveness is associated with judges levying smaller fines in actual cases. The research proposed here will expose the perceptual and neural factors that affect the formation and the (non-flexible) persistence of first impressions. Therefore, in addition to understanding the perceptual and neural bases of first impressions, the studies proposed here have direct social implications. Because the activation of first impressions is so rapid, it is reasonable to suspect that the perceptual features that mediate their formation are processed quickly, and therefore are either primitive in their structure, or analyzed on a coarse level. If we could define those physical elements that non-consciously affect our first impressions and attitudes, we may be in a better position to modulate their influence on our life. To address these issues, I propose combining behavioral experiments that apply theory and paradigms from perception and cognitive neuroscience with recently developed brain imaging techniques. Specifically, the studies will focus on the formation and persistence of first impression. The first step will be to reveal the 'vocabulary' of perceptual primitives that determine first impressions. These are the specific physical properties in the appearance of a person or an object that non-consciously shape our attitude. For example, studies with brief visual presentations of various pictures indicate that observers judge figures containing sharp edges as possessing aggressive traits, whereas the same figures are judged as more positive when the edges are smooth. Another example of a basic physical feature that conveys a complex trait was reported in a study where black color of sports uniforms was associated with subjective perception of aggressiveness. To define this \"list\" of perceptual primitives that influence the formation of attitudes and impressions, we will use subliminal visual priming. We will very briefly present a visual image that may have an emotional valence, such that observers are not aware of it. Immediately following this subliminal presentation, we will present a neutral target object that is readily recognizable. Participants will then rate how much they like the target picture, or how much they think it is threatening, or how much they would like to own the target object. In searching for impression-forming features, we will focus on stimuli with social and survival-related significance, such as patterns that convey a threat, patterns with sharp vs. smooth edges, animals, food, facial parts, and faces that may be associated with specific stereotypes. If the prime stimulus (i.e., the subliminal pattern that precedes the target) affects participants' liking judgments regarding the neutral target, we will infer that this is an impression-forming feature. In a second set of experiments, we will use brain imaging to examine our hypothesis regarding how these impression-forming features are analyzed and propagated in the brain. The gist of this hypothesis is that our brains have evolved to analyze information that represents a possible danger more quickly than neutral information. Incoming sensory information is analyzed thoroughly, on a fine-grained level, along a hierarchy of cortical regions. At the same time, however, critical information may directly be relayed in a coarse form via 'cortical shortcuts' from low- to high-level regions to guide a specific behavior. For example, because sharp edges may reliably predict dangerous objects, quickly analyzing and avoiding them may facilitate survival. Or, if we encounter a lion in the woods, we should be able to act based on coarse-level information that conveys the general shape, rather than wait until all the fine details (e.g., color and texture) have been analyzed. We will identify these 'cortical shortcuts,' or direct pathways, using recently developed techniques for combining multiple brain imaging methods. This combination is powerful because it takes advantage of the spatial resolution of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and the temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) so that we can monitor brain activity within a spatial resolution of about 1 millimeter and a temporal resolution of about 1 millisecond. We will study these cortical shortcuts by manipulating parameters that are expected to modulate their use, while imaging the corresponding events in the brain. First, we will define and characterize these shortcuts, which will be done by comparing the cortical dynamics during the perception of impression-forming stimuli and the perception of neutral stimuli. Then, in a second set of experiments, we will correlate the activation of the cortical shortcuts, as measured with brain imaging, to level of subjective attitude, as measured behaviorally. Consequently, these experiments will allow a characterization of the cortical 'shortcut' pathways that facilitate the formation of first impressions by rapidly relaying critical information to high-level regions in the brain. Finally, we will address the issue of persistence. Persistent first impressions have a clear advantage for survival. For example, if some sensory cues reliably indicate that something in our environment is dangerous, it is in our best interest to remain alert while in its neighborhood. In other contexts, however, some first impressions can be misleading and need to be updated with the perception of new information. Revealing the aspects that modulate the persistence of first impressions, therefore, has important implications for everyday life in that such an understanding may allow us to monitor their influence. We will examine the environmental factors and brain mechanisms that mediate its magnitude and 'life-span.' This effort, too, will be divided between behavioral experiments and the use of brain imaging. Factors that we predict may have the potential to modify persistent first impressions include whether the participants are aware of the source of the influence on their impression formation, and the type of the impression (e.g., positive or negative). We will manipulate those factors and study their affect on the persistence of first impressions. In addition, we will examine potential methods for modifying persistent first impressions. For example, we will try to modify a certain impression (e.g., negative) by repeatedly associating it with an opposite impression-forming feature (e.g., positive). Not only do such methods have widespread social implications, they will also allow us to image neural processes involved in the formation, persistence and modification of first impressions. By bridging between perception, cognitive neuroscience, and social behavior, it is expected that this research program will illuminate the underpinning of first impressions, and increase our appreciation of their influence on social interaction in everyday life.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Massachusetts General Hospital', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002039\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '449,997', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

For example, the human genome has now been completely and precisely mapped. However, humans still don't understand how the simplest of emergent properties arise in these systems. Emergent properties are things like consciousness in humans, or resilience to perturbation in ecosystems, that we wouldn't have predicted to occur or exist given the sum of the parts. Despite humankinds' increasing technological know-how, properties like these remain a mystery. Their understanding remains a challenge of both basic and practical interest. Basic interest simply because humans desire to know how things function. Practical interest because complex systems are part of our everyday lives, for example in the form of ecosystems and economies, and we need to understand how they will react to the increasing stresses placed upon them, and how new systems will re-organize when they replace the old. Complex systems are usually hierarchically organized, and possess a number of emergent properties that makes their understanding of great interest. Hierarchies are systems with multiple levels of organization where each level is semi-independent and formed from the interactions among a set of variables that share similar speeds. Communication between levels consists only of a small set of information or of material, and flows to the next higher and slower level. This structure allows wide variation in particulars within levels, and encourages adaptive change and exploration of alternatives. Ecologists embraced the transfer of the term hierarchy to complex ecological systems and developed its application to a wide variety of ecological relationships and structures. Theoretical understanding was increased by shifting attention from the smallscale perspectives dominant in ecology, to a multi-scale landscape view that recognized the cross-scale interactions between biotic and abiotic processes.  Despite theoretical advances resulting from hierarchy theory, most current models of the organization of ecological systems implicitly represent species and their ecological functions as operating at the same scale. Ecological systems, however, are not scale invariant. Different species operate at different temporal and spatial scales, as do ecological processes. Small and fast scales are dominated by biophysical processes that control physiology and morphology, while the very largest scales are dominated by climate and geomorphological processes The scaling of physical, biological, ecological and social phenomena has become a major focus of efforts to develop simple representations of complex systems. One approach to analyzing the cross-scale structure of ecosystems has been to search for scaling relationships derived from basic processes that capture the variation found across all scales. These efforts have identified and described a number of interesting scaling laws. However, there has been almost no focus upon the structure and dynamics of scale breaks-- scales that are in-between two different scaling regimes. Ecological and biological hierarchies appear to exhibit multiple scale regimes. There are breaks between levels as processes controlling structure shift from one set to another. For example, the analysis of vegetation pattern on landscapes has shown that different scaling regimes exist. The analyses of animal community patterns also have revealed a cross-scale pattern of multiple scale regimes, shown by the clumping of animal characteristics such as size. Brian Walker and colleagues have shown that morphological characteristics of plants are also unevenly distributed, and that these characteristics aggregate into distinct groups that correspond to ecological functions. Analyses of community organization have revealed that species' body size, which strongly correspond to the scales at which a species lives, are unevenly distributed. These aggregations suggest that ecosystems are not simply following allometric laws, but that the interaction of plants, animals, and their environment varies with scale and produces ecological patterns that vary across scales in a discontinuous fashion. Understanding the organization and dynamics of ecosystems and other complex systems within and across scales offers the potential to assess both the resilience of ecosystems and the vulnerability of particular components. In ecosystems, the distribution of species' body masses should exhibit a pattern that reflects the system's organization and this pattern should provide information on basic ecological properties of that ecosystem. Analyses of patterns in the distribution of animal body masses demonstrate that these body mass distributions are discontinuous. That is to say, across the range of body masses an a size axis, there are areas where body masses tend to aggregate, and there are areas where no species of that particular size occurs. Because body mass correlates so strongly with a whole suite of ecological attributes of a species, like life span, step length, and home range size, it provides an excellent proxy for the scale at which these species interact with their environment. Thus, discontinuities in body mass distributions reflect discontinuities--and available scales--in the environments in which these animals live. Discontinuities in animal body mass distributions identify scale breaks in the organization of ecological systems. In hierarchical complex systems, there are breaks between levels as processes controlling structure shift from one set to another. Scale breaks in characteristics of animal communities such as body masses correlate strongly with a set of poorly understood biological phenomena that consist of contrasting attributes. These phenomena include invasion, extinction, high population variability, migration and nomadism. In other words, high variability at the species, population and community levels. Recently, with colleagues, I demonstrated that the body masses of endangered and invasive species in a community occur at the edges of body mass aggregations 2-4 times as often as expected by chance. That correlation is consistent in all 8 data sets examined so far. Those data include four different taxa in two different ecosystems. The strong correspondence between the independent attributes of population status and body-mass pattern in three different taxa confirms the existence of discontinuous body mass distributions. It may seem initially surprising that both invasive and declining species are located at the edge of body-mass aggregations. These results suggest that something similar must be shared by the two extreme biological conditions represented by invasive species and declining species. An examination of the phenomena of nomadism in birds in an Australian Mediterranean climate ecosystem found that nomadic birds too cluster about scale breaks. The clustering of these phenomena at predictable scale breaks suggests variability in resource distribution or availability is greatest at these states. Is this true in other systems? Careful investigation of the partitioning of diversity within and across scales, the importance of scale breaks and the phenomena associated with scale breaks may lead to fruitful avenues of investigation in the analysis of ecological, economic and social systems. For example, high (resource) variability can be bath a detriment (i.e., the association between extinct and declining species and scale breaks) or a boon (the success of invasive species at scale breaks). I suggest that this discontinuous pattern has predictive power: species, community, and population turnover in landscapes subject to human transformation tend to be located at the edge of body-mass aggregations, which may be transition zones between distinct ranges of scale. Location at scale breaks affords species great opportunity, but also potential crisis. There are several puzzles related to this association that need to be solved. Under what circumstances is it beneficial to exploit or specialize at scale breaks? When a system's resilience is exceeded (or approached?) do species/organizations associated with scale breaks unravel first? What are economic or social indicators that exhibit scale breaks? If there are such lumps in the size of firms, are the ones on the edge of lumps similarly functionally unique? In the size of cities? In the size of the gross national product of nations, or exports? Answering these questions, and thereby better understanding the structure of complex systems such as ecosystems and urban networks, should also provide better understanding of the emergent properties that arise from these structures. Transformation of the Earth's surface, to a degree that surely exceeds the imagination of anyone living at the previous turn of the century, is proceeding without abatement or slowdown. Urban areas in the United States are sprawling at rates that exceed population growth many fold. Ecological systems are under greater and greater stress, and becoming more and more like islands. The Earth is composed of complex systems such as ecosystems, urban networks, and economies. How, or even if, these systems cope with stresses is vitally important to humanity as it proceeds wildly into the 21st century. Understanding their basic structure is the first step.", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Clemson University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002037\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '448,916', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}

Try to imagine living in a world where neither you, nor anything around you, were animate. Even if you could fathom such a world, it would be senseless, literally, because there would be no way to affect your surroundings and thus there would be no need to sense anything at all. Of course no organism lives in such conditions. To be capable of perceiving one's place in the world and the actions and behaviors of other objects is of immense importance to all animals. It turns out that of the six senses (we include kinesthesia, or the sense of body position and movement, which is often overlooked as a primary sense), primates have become particularly dependent on the sense of sight, and a disproportionate amount of the primate brain appears to be involved in vision. Because humans are so dependent on vision, significant scientific effort has been directed at understanding how we perceive the world through our sense of sight. The process of vision, of course, begins at the eye, and as far as the brain is concerned, at the eye's retina. From this starting point, many people conceive of the problem of vision as converting the retinal image into percepts and then into recognized wholes. This snapshot view of vision, where the eye is likened to a camera and the brain likened to a computer, may be an intriguing analogy, but it largely ignores the fact that we live in a dynamic, not a static, world. What makes the world's great photographers special is that they are uniquely capable of capturing the essence of their subject in a single frame. Fortunately, since most of us are rather amateur photographers, we don't have to depend on these once in a lifetime snapshots. Instead, we are adept at appreciating the subtle, or not so subtle, dynamics present in the world. How our nervous systems extract a coherent view of a complex, dynamic world is still unknown. Observations of children with autism, a pervasive developmental disorder, suggest that these individuals may lack the kind of global coherence most people simply take for granted. Consider the description of Jerry, a young boy with autism, by Uta Frith (from ): \"Nothing seemed constant; everything was unpredictable and strange. Animate beings were a particular problem\". Frith argues that the central deficit in autism is an inability to cope with the sensory complexities encountered in everyday life, which stems from a fragmented perception of the world. The social and communicative difficulties presented by autistic individuals emphasize the importance of creating a coherent, or unified, impression from a dynamic array of sensory impressions. The research objectives presented in this project are aimed at addressing this relatively neglected aspect of brain science. In particular, we will explore how primates, both human and non-human, abstract meaningful events from the animate actions of other forms. We stress that perceiving the actions of others is by no means a capacity unique to humans. Many animals live in environments where the activity of prey, predators, or conspecifics must be constantly evaluated. In primate social groups, individuals can clearly make use of the behavioral cues of others to guide their own actions. Vervet monkeys, for example, elicit characteristic calls following detection of a predatory eagle, leopard, or python, and the acoustic properties of the call is used by other monkeys seek safe haven depending on the particular enemy's natural route of attack. Similarly, primates are keenly sensitive to the gestural signals displayed by others, the properties of which can be used to predict impending behavior or to assess social status. Our goal in the proposed research program will be to walk the fine line between ecologically valid fieldwork and traditional laboratory science. We believe that to uncover the mechanisms involved in the processing of dynamic, realistic events, like those encountered in the real world, an animal must be tested in these conditions. The technology boom of the last twenty years has brought with it the possibility of creating at least virtual renditions of these complex worlds in the laboratory. Virtual three-dimensional objects, with associated animate behaviors, can be created and presented on graphics hardware in a way that subjects can learn to identify these objects based on their structural composition or their actions. Because these stimuli are computer generated, subtle aspects of their form and articulated motion can be systematically manipulated, and an observer's ability to detect these changes can be assessed. One look at a child engrossed in any current video game adventure and it is clear that these environments, and their associated inhabitants, can be very real indeed. Our initial aim will be to demonstrate that monkeys are inherently capable of learning to recognize the actions of novel, realistic objects. From this starting point we will embark upon the second component of our research plan, which is to better understand the role the brain plays in this process. Significant progress has been made in describing the basic properties of individual neurons--the nervous system's building blocks--in the primate brain. One of the great discoveries in the last forty years is that is possible to record, in a pain-free way, the activity of these cells in the behaving brain. In this way, it has been possible to directly relate the response of single cells to the perceptual and motor activity of the whole animal. Currently, however, most of this information has been acquired under extremely simplified conditions. This cautious approach is understandable, since it seems hardly believable that the actions of single cells could ever be directly linked to more complex situations. We have recently found, though, that in the domain of vision, the activity of single neurons in the temporal lobes of monkeys is clearly related to the act of noticing familiar targets, even when these objects are hidden in complex naturalistic scenes. Furthermore, these findings were made under conditions where monkeys could freely scan these scenes. The results augmented data from our earlier work, which showed that neural activity in these areas was best correlated with the perceptual state of the animal, and not the physical stimulus imaged by the eyes. Encouraged by these findings, we believe it will be possible to relate the activity of single neurons, and groups of neurons, to some of the fundamental problems in visual cognition. By studying the problem of perceiving animate form, we will be forced to think about how the brain groups dynamic patterns of optical information into coherent acts. By training monkeys to differentiate between behaviors like BOUNCING or FLIPPING or FROWNING, can we then determine how the brain encodes these recognized actions? Will these representations be independent of the underlying objects performing the actions? Can these representations be detected in the activity of single cells, or only in the conjoint activity of populations of cells? Can we watch these representations develop as new objects and actions are first encountered and then learned? And if we do find answers to these questions, can they help us understand how such circuitry may malfunction? One might ask whether the physiologist's reductionist methodology is appropriate for asking questions of cognitive function. How can the records of neural activity from a tiny proportion of nerve cells hope to offer any insights that cannot be deduced from behavior alone? Our view is that if these studies are carried out at the very same time that the capacities at issue are being demonstrated, we do have a chance of observing not just that, but also how, the brain makes sense of a complex world. In doing so, we hope to better understand what Huxley called \"Man's place in nature\".", "program_of_funder": null, "comments": null, "raw_source_data": "{'org_name': 'Brown University', 'researcher': None, 'program': None, 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.37717/21002027\\n', 'year': '2001', 'amount': '397,500', 'country': None}", "_award_schema_version": "0.1.1"}
